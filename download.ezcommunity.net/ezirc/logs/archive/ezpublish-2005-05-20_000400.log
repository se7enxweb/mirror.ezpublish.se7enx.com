[05-19-2005 02:00:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey fh, is ez still doing 2.x support, i only ask as i have a problem with a 2.x client installation which apears to be storing another user's session's ezuser_user_id in the (order & wishlist) tables (which has been a nightmare to try to track down), i'm thinking about submiting a request for some support / testing of the site to find / ensure the breakdown is resolved ... :|
[05-19-2005 02:01:03] [#ezpublish] <fh> I think we are still doing some 2.x support from time to time

[05-19-2005 03:35:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh? so fh tell me i was wrong
[05-19-2005 03:35:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> please?
[05-19-2005 03:35:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then i would know where i myself went wrong
[05-19-2005 03:36:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> cause from a certain 'perspective', i have the freedom to do what others simply can't do ... an the silence almost tells me too...
[05-19-2005 03:37:14] [#ezpublish] <fh> I don't have any answers
[05-19-2005 03:37:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> being a company man is tuff :(
[05-19-2005 03:37:48] [#ezpublish] <fh> tell me about it
[05-19-2005 03:38:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i respect the rank
[05-19-2005 03:38:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what did they say in band of brothers, you salute the rank not the man (doesn't apply as much in this sudo context as I actualy do respect you and the rest of the ez crew)
[05-19-2005 03:39:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> still i've been shhhhhd by an employer before, so i can relate to  the score
[05-19-2005 03:42:41] [#ezpublish] <fh> have you been shhhhd by us?
[05-19-2005 03:42:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> never that i can remember
[05-19-2005 03:42:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i respect that too

[05-19-2005 03:44:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kewl
[05-19-2005 03:45:17] [#ezpublish] <fh> yep, a few issues to iron out still
[05-19-2005 03:45:23] [#ezpublish] <fh> but 3.6 looks solid
[05-19-2005 03:46:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> right on! will we see rc2 or slipstream into 3.6
[05-19-2005 03:46:32] [#ezpublish] <fh> but you feel like you are not heard I gather..
[05-19-2005 03:46:42] [#ezpublish] <fh> we'll go right to 3.6
[05-19-2005 03:46:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods, sometimes
[05-19-2005 03:47:14] [#ezpublish] <fh> we've had very few bug reports on RC1.. that is why
[05-19-2005 03:47:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've been doing this 'like this' for so long that sometimes i question everything i've ever stood for, seriously i just need to network with others in the community
[05-19-2005 03:47:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum 'like this' (fairly isolated)
[05-19-2005 03:48:16] [#ezpublish] <fh> what kind of support are you looking for
[05-19-2005 03:48:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> not sure what you mean
[05-19-2005 03:49:13] [#ezpublish] <fh> What I mean is.. when do you feel you're not heard... and how can we improve on it... or support you
[05-19-2005 03:50:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh, in the comunity, i guess i would love to have a talk with people who see what i do to kinda say anything more critical than go kracker! cause it seems like i've already topp'd a number of others previous hurdles, but really i'm still a beginer compared to the crew, i have a long way to go
[05-19-2005 03:50:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lots more to learn, processes to improve, working smarter instead of harder, these arn't really very good answeres to a really apreciated question (thnx:)
[05-19-2005 03:51:53] [#ezpublish] <fh> you know.. when I got into open source software I sort of expected people to praise us programmers for all the hard work we put into stuff.. to get some recognition out of it
[05-19-2005 03:51:59] [#ezpublish] <fh> but it just isn't they way it works
[05-19-2005 03:52:09] [#ezpublish] <fh> 95% of all feedback I get is from angry people
[05-19-2005 03:52:30] [#ezpublish] <fh> who tell me that something sucks or that you don't have this or that
[05-19-2005 03:52:35] [#ezpublish] <fh> or even worse.. that I'm stupid
[05-19-2005 03:52:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> perhapse i need think about what i could use best, or perhapse i need to listen to myself a bit more, build some more quick hit list for beter forum answeres to obscurely worded questions, or just do more development to keep more fresh on the sea of issues i've never touched ...
[05-19-2005 03:52:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eyah i get that a lot moonlighting here in the usa
[05-19-2005 03:53:33] [#ezpublish] <fh> I've learned not to expect to much positive feedback and to ignore most of the negative.. (ignore the none constructive negative criticism)
[05-19-2005 03:54:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the customers love to threaten you with a feature port to another product if they don't get a fix they prolly should pay for and or golden magic garentee that nothing bad can happen again... when it's usualy their own negligence that has propogated the core breakdown
[05-19-2005 03:54:41] [#ezpublish] <fh> hehe
[05-19-2005 03:54:45] [#ezpublish] <fh> that sounds familiar
[05-19-2005 03:54:56] [#ezpublish] <fh> are you coming to the camp?
[05-19-2005 03:55:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that's educating customers in sw dev / maint / etc i guess
[05-19-2005 03:57:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i wish i could go back and not have gone on hiadus in march, and changed my plans, but i missed the deadline again (knowingly i'm afraid) cause .... cause of money that i misapropriated trying to relocate my life to friendly state (texas didn't blow up like i hoped, too hot)
[05-19-2005 03:58:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so i'm still left in the middle of a move, and a lot of work to do. I can't say i'm proud of my descion (it really was the worse, just about as the conditions surounding it, when it's what i really needed all along, it's a battle)
[05-19-2005 04:01:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> all these years left saying ... next year i can afford it, each year that being more true with even less time to get away with the get away), i swear if things don't falldown with my most recent mexican standoff (venture capitalist...) i'm making him foot the bill (like, here expense it!

[05-19-2005 04:07:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> from personal experiance irc via your favorite shell irc client (bitchx) works great on a remote server using GNU Screen
[05-19-2005 04:08:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> especialy for all those people who get diconnected frequently, screen keeps you connected even if you loose your session / connection to the remote shell server
[05-19-2005 04:08:51] [#ezpublish] <@fh> kracker: yep, I think you're right.. this is the second time

[05-19-2005 04:10:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you know
[05-19-2005 04:19:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> fh: you know... i think every time you drop that line, what more can we do to support you, (great line btw) i always choke cause you all have already done so much, now cause i started (what? bitchin), i'm going to get more?!? i mean that would be neat if i could figure out what would be apropriate without it being a burden or dumb, in the end it just really reminds me how much farscape i have to travel on my own to build up my skillsets before i can
[05-19-2005 04:20:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> (i question what i'm really saying or where i'm going with this ikea boy), i do apreciate you sayin it again though (it in part is like good'o smack on the back)
[05-19-2005 04:21:06] [#ezpublish] <@fh> you are a customer you know.. I always try to do my best to support customers that are actually contributing to the community
[05-19-2005 04:21:21] [#ezpublish] <@fh> not that many of you around...
[05-19-2005 04:22:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> thnx, but it's just never enough (or all to often it feels), perhapse i'm just too .... something. i look back at all i've done and i laugh as i snear at it smugly..)
[05-19-2005 04:23:02] [#ezpublish] <@fh> true.. it is never enough
[05-19-2005 04:23:15] [#ezpublish] <@fh> I can work 30 hours per day.. still people will not be satisfied
[05-19-2005 04:23:20] [#ezpublish] <@fh> but this is just the way it is
[05-19-2005 04:23:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i am so a customer ( and i do mean with negative context / subtext )
[05-19-2005 04:24:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it is what i love to do, at some point break you gotta just let go

[05-19-2005 04:26:18] [#ezpublish] <@fh> and thanks for the chat..

[05-19-2005 16:14:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i have not touched it just yet
[05-19-2005 16:14:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ?
[05-19-2005 16:14:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry? collaboration-thing?
[05-19-2005 16:15:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. the collaboration functionality
[05-19-2005 16:16:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> at least there are some templates.
[05-19-2005 16:16:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> like: design/standard/templates/collaboration/view/summary.tpl
[05-19-2005 16:21:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm ... but where i can access these pages?!

[05-19-2005 16:23:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> fh: hi
[05-19-2005 16:23:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> fh: is there a proper documentation on the collaboration-thing?
[05-19-2005 16:24:23] [#ezpublish] <fh> nope
[05-19-2005 16:24:25] [#ezpublish] <fh> sorry
[05-19-2005 16:25:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> fh: where can i access any view within the admin- oder the web- interface?
[05-19-2005 16:26:36] [#ezpublish] <fh> what do you mean?
[05-19-2005 16:26:51] [#ezpublish] <fh> you can access any view if you are the admin user (and unless you have set deny rules on any of the view)
[05-19-2005 16:27:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. are in the admin-interface any functions on collaboration?
[05-19-2005 16:28:09] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> fh: i am totally new to this topic.
[05-19-2005 16:28:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> sorry.
[05-19-2005 16:29:10] [#ezpublish] <fh> np..
[05-19-2005 16:29:28] [#ezpublish] <fh> yes, there are a few function on collaboration if you go to "my page"
[05-19-2005 16:29:44] [#ezpublish] <fh> the collaboration features are somewhat obscure..
[05-19-2005 16:29:53] [#ezpublish] <fh> definately something we are going to clean up in 4.0
[05-19-2005 16:30:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> also in relation to the workflow-engine?
[05-19-2005 16:30:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> will the collaboration the basis of the workflow-engine?
[05-19-2005 16:31:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> where the workitems are stored for workflow-partipants?
[05-19-2005 16:31:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +zi
[05-19-2005 16:34:05] [#ezpublish] <fh> actually workflow and collaboration has nothing to do with each other
[05-19-2005 16:34:37] [#ezpublish] <fh> workflow is the system we use to exten functionality with php code at some predifined places in ez publish
[05-19-2005 16:35:15] [#ezpublish] <fh> collaboration is the system that deals with publishing approval
[05-19-2005 16:35:26] [#ezpublish] <fh> collaboration is wrongly named.. it should be called workflow
[05-19-2005 16:35:38] [#ezpublish] <fh> and the workflow system should be called something else
[05-19-2005 16:36:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> doh .. crazy
[05-19-2005 16:36:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i would the current workflow-system consists of general actions and triggers.
[05-19-2005 16:37:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> -i would
[05-19-2005 16:37:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-19-2005 16:38:19] [#ezpublish] <fh> the workflow system in eZ publish just consists of hot spots in the code
[05-19-2005 16:38:27] [#ezpublish] <fh> where you can plug in custom code
[05-19-2005 16:38:34] [#ezpublish] <fh> quite simple actually

[05-19-2005 16:39:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this actually has nothing to do with a workflow-definition and a workflow-engine processing it.
[05-19-2005 16:40:01] [#ezpublish] <fh> exactly
[05-19-2005 16:40:12] [#ezpublish] <fh> which is why it is wrongly named
[05-19-2005 16:40:16] [#ezpublish] <fh> if you ask me
[05-19-2005 16:40:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yes, i would agree to you ;)
[05-19-2005 16:40:46] [#ezpublish] <fh> I want to change it for 4.0
[05-19-2005 16:41:03] [#ezpublish] <fh> but people know these terms now.. so I don't know..
[05-19-2005 16:41:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i want to implement a workflow-engine?
[05-19-2005 16:41:17] [#ezpublish] <fh> but it is definately confusing for many people
[05-19-2005 16:41:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> s/i/you/
[05-19-2005 16:43:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> I would change these expressions as they are already definied by the computer science.
[05-19-2005 16:46:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. how can i create a new collaboration item?
[05-19-2005 16:47:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> how can i define groups ?
[05-19-2005 16:48:22] [#ezpublish] <fh> can you ask again tomorrow?
[05-19-2005 16:48:29] [#ezpublish] <fh> almost midnight here
[05-19-2005 16:48:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok ;)
[05-19-2005 16:48:35] [#ezpublish] <fh> and I need some sleep
[05-19-2005 16:48:37] [#ezpublish] <fh> :)
[05-19-2005 16:48:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> here the same ;)
