[05-05-2005 01:43:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> reminds me of me working on ezpub.co.uk back in 5/2004
[05-05-2005 01:43:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hehe
[05-05-2005 01:45:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> what is ezpub?
[05-05-2005 01:45:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ezpub.co.uk
[05-05-2005 01:46:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ur project?
[05-05-2005 01:46:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah
[05-05-2005 01:46:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the "eZ pub" was one of the first eZ publish (v3) community portals
[05-05-2005 01:46:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it lived and died a quick death from lack of community support
[05-05-2005 01:46:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i could imagine
[05-05-2005 01:47:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it did some good work, and reminded me a lot of my eZ publish 3 learning back in 2002
[05-05-2005 01:47:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> a ez-wiki would also be nice.
[05-05-2005 01:47:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i've since moved on to other eZ projects for the community, i'll clean up the mess i left very shortly
[05-05-2005 01:47:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> checkout http://snippets.ezpublishhosting.com/

[05-05-2005 01:55:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eesh, hard to say when you have to run so hard to just pay for cost of living and doing nothing but eZ publish dev/doc/and more

[05-05-2005 02:47:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can create, edit and remove template overrides almost completely from the above administration GUI
[05-05-2005 02:47:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> me idiot
[05-05-2005 02:47:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sure, youcan do it per design

[05-05-2005 02:54:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmmm .. creating a new override template, for what is the node_id to be set?
[05-05-2005 02:54:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> as an override key?
[05-05-2005 02:56:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no
[05-05-2005 02:56:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i mean its an option for override keys.
[05-05-2005 02:56:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the node_id is the id of the content object which you wish to overide the default template
[05-05-2005 02:57:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if you mouse over an existing object in the 3.5+ admin menu you will get a js display (popup) of the menu item
[05-05-2005 02:57:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this should be called object_id
[05-05-2005 02:57:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well ... it depends on the basis of the software's termenology.
[05-05-2005 02:58:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hey i don't know if the ez.no docs have this yet but users could use an ... eZ publish Dictonary
[05-05-2005 02:58:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ez uses the terminoloy node_id and object_id
[05-05-2005 02:58:47] -!- buz [~buz@217-162-134-214.dclient.hispeed.ch] has joined #ezpublish
[05-05-2005 02:58:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> node_id is related to the content tree
[05-05-2005 02:59:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> a list of terms, in a big index
[05-05-2005 02:59:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> to explain the difference between the two
[05-05-2005 02:59:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i know it.
[05-05-2005 03:00:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok
[05-05-2005 03:00:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> object_id is the id of the content object which can be assigned to a node_id within the content tree
[05-05-2005 03:01:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh very ggod, no more searching fo me :)
[05-05-2005 03:01:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[05-05-2005 03:02:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so the node_id in this context implies that the template is used during displaying a part of the content tree which makes no sense for me.
[05-05-2005 03:03:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> as the template is rather assigned to a content class.
[05-05-2005 03:07:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> templates can be assigned based on several different criteria, not just per class but also per individual content object (node_id)
[05-05-2005 03:08:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> also based on section
[05-05-2005 03:08:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yeah ... ok
[05-05-2005 03:08:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but a section_id would make more sense?!
[05-05-2005 03:08:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they use a drop down select box instead of an id
[05-05-2005 03:09:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmmm ... gonna check this out.
[05-05-2005 03:09:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> a node_id is an instanciated content object for a particular class, it's bad form to get fixated on object_id, it's not about objects, it's about nodes ...
[05-05-2005 03:11:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> kracker | >a node_id is an instanciated content object for a particular class <- i would disagree. node_id is a part of the content tree with its nodes. but a content object is representated by a object_id, the instance.
[05-05-2005 03:11:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> an content object might not be assigned to the content tree.
[05-05-2005 03:12:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> then it would not be an object
[05-05-2005 03:12:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it would an UN-instanciated class
[05-05-2005 03:13:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Rule of Thumb: all objects are classes but classes are not objects
[05-05-2005 03:13:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so why is a content object to more then one node_id assignable?
[05-05-2005 03:13:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can't have a content object that is not assigned to the content tree
[05-05-2005 03:13:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> unless perhapse in the case of a Draft of a content object (that might work as you describe)
[05-05-2005 03:14:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this is because its sorted in on creation to the content tree which is mandatory.
[05-05-2005 03:14:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but keep in mind we have a trash.
[05-05-2005 03:14:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yeah draft is another example for that.
[05-05-2005 03:14:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> because in several situations content objects should be allowed to existing in more than one location as a location is just a virtual link and there is nothing to prevent an object from being displayed in several locations inside thecontent structure
[05-05-2005 03:15:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> think of it like a gmail.com mail account
[05-05-2005 03:15:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yea this stresses what i am saying.
[05-05-2005 03:16:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can assign several different "lables" (aka locations) to a single email
[05-05-2005 03:16:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's the future, folders are depricated / dead ... labels / mulit-location is the future
[05-05-2005 03:16:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> < SEAwolfx_>object_id is the id of the content object which can be assigned to a node_id within the content tree
[05-05-2005 03:17:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> isnt that true?
[05-05-2005 03:17:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it is ture
[05-05-2005 03:17:17] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it is true
[05-05-2005 03:17:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but for most cases users don't work with object_id only node_id
[05-05-2005 03:18:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so when we speak of a node_id its a unique place in the content tree.
[05-05-2005 03:18:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> like a developer would use object_id in custom development but users tend to only use node_id
[05-05-2005 03:18:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yes
[05-05-2005 03:18:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yes it is a unique id
[05-05-2005 03:18:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so when i write template i dont think of a unique place in the content tree.
[05-05-2005 03:18:57] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh?
[05-05-2005 03:19:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> only a subtree or a section
[05-05-2005 03:19:17] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> section = subtree
[05-05-2005 03:20:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> we are mincing words here, your subtree (which can be a section at the same time) would be a specific branch / part of the content structure
[05-05-2005 03:20:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yes.
[05-05-2005 03:21:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think you would need to at least to create at least one location in the content structure to store your content objects even if you hide it (per say) from the regualar user ...
[05-05-2005 03:21:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i would consider templates are related to more than one node in the tree.

[05-05-2005 03:22:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> back to my misunterstanding, why i can assign a template to a node_id (one node in content tree)
[05-05-2005 03:22:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they can be, but it doesn't mean that they are unless you configure it that way :) very flexible
[05-05-2005 03:23:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ahhhh
[05-05-2005 03:23:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so its possible to envoke a template only for one node?
[05-05-2005 03:23:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> That feature provides you a way to override a single content object , for a single node_id
[05-05-2005 03:23:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> AHHHHHHH
[05-05-2005 03:23:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this was the missing link.
[05-05-2005 03:24:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> nice option.
[05-05-2005 03:24:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if i wanted to change a template in a unique way for ONLY one object you would use nod_id

[05-05-2005 03:37:10] [#ezpublish] <xbit> then there's probably some script or plugin to add that functionality to it?

[05-05-2005 03:54:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> need some help ... want to create a template for the new rss class. now i create a new override fo "/node/view/full.tpl", set the siteaccess, filename: "rss.tpl", override keys: class: rss; section: all sectios; node_id: -, base template on: empty file", pressed ok, then rss appears in "design/<siteaccess>/override/templates/rss.tpl". doesnt have it to be created in design/<siteaccess>/override/templates/full/ ?
[05-05-2005 04:02:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> .
[05-05-2005 04:03:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i followed http://ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/incoming/setting_up_rss_import

[05-05-2005 04:04:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no
[05-05-2005 04:04:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it doesn't
[05-05-2005 04:05:20] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that relationship is abstracted in the settings/siteaccess/siteName/override.ini.append.php
[05-05-2005 04:05:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> entries
[05-05-2005 04:05:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it sounds like it created the file correctly
[05-05-2005 04:06:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i am not entirely sure that the override keys were set correctly but it sounds basicly right ..
[05-05-2005 04:07:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i have a lack in understanding how the creation process, including all entries which are done
[05-05-2005 04:07:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sure, it takes a while to grasp 100%
[05-05-2005 04:07:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's a very flexable and extensible system
[05-05-2005 04:08:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> which means there is usualy more than one way to the job
[05-05-2005 04:09:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> how would u do it only on the basis of the filesystem
[05-05-2005 04:09:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ?
[05-05-2005 04:09:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> concerning to the new rss class?
[05-05-2005 04:09:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> basicly the admin gui creates the entries needed to override settings needed (into ettings/siteaccess/siteName/override.ini.append.php) to override the default templates
[05-05-2005 04:10:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no not really

[05-05-2005 04:10:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i dont see any.
[05-05-2005 04:10:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no?>
[05-05-2005 04:10:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what is the name of your siteaccess and design your using?
[05-05-2005 04:10:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> any related to templates.
[05-05-2005 04:11:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> is it a default siteaccess
[05-05-2005 04:11:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> web
[05-05-2005 04:11:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum are you using a stock design (like copy / rename corporate) or are you starting from scratch
[05-05-2005 04:11:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i already know that there u can set the relation between the siteaccess and the deisgn
[05-05-2005 04:12:06] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if your starting from scratch that would make sense but if your working from a copy of a default eZ tempaltes ?
[05-05-2005 04:12:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but thats all.
[05-05-2005 04:12:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this is already done.

[05-05-2005 04:12:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i have a own design dir.
[05-05-2005 04:12:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok
[05-05-2005 04:13:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so here comes an example ...
[05-05-2005 04:13:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i also have knowledge about the override templates in my design dir.
[05-05-2005 04:14:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i only dont understand where the relationship between the new class to the new template is set.
[05-05-2005 04:14:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i think of by name of the tpl-file
[05-05-2005 04:22:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> these entry were done by using the process over the admin interface i guess.
[05-05-2005 04:23:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the top  ones yes
[05-05-2005 04:23:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the onese on the bottom (perhapse) it's hard to say for certain
[05-05-2005 04:24:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ok .. i understand
[05-05-2005 04:24:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> because i _prefer_ to create my templates 100% by hand as much as possible so I do not use the eZ publish admininistrator to create new template overrides ... i do it all by hand
[05-05-2005 04:24:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i would prefer this too ;)

[05-05-2005 04:25:04] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> hi all
[05-05-2005 04:25:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it just takes a little practice
[05-05-2005 04:25:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> practice makes perfect

[05-05-2005 04:25:55] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> is it ok to ask n00b questions here? :P
[05-05-2005 04:26:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> if you have a little pacients with us :)
[05-05-2005 04:26:48] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> hehe
[05-05-2005 04:26:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's way too late for me to be trying to spell big words ... ug
[05-05-2005 04:27:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but a last question to this: what has to be overriden when inside of a folder the rss items should appear? i think the node/view/full.tpl
[05-05-2005 04:27:11] [#ezpublish] * kracker has blury vision ...
[05-05-2005 04:27:27] [#ezpublish] <xbit> syntetisk: fire at will, n00b questions are better than meta-questions imo :)
[05-05-2005 04:27:42] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hehe
[05-05-2005 04:27:44] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> I'm sure i'm missing something fundamental about eZ, but I gotta ask anyway...
[05-05-2005 04:27:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> checking
[05-05-2005 04:28:15] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> how do I translate an eZ site to another language than english, ex. Norwegian
[05-05-2005 04:28:28] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> not the content, but everyting else
[05-05-2005 04:29:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> SEAWolf, wait a sec k
[05-05-2005 04:29:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> np ;)
[05-05-2005 04:29:12] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> because now my site has norwegian articles, but the "framework" is in english
[05-05-2005 04:30:05] [#ezpublish] <xbit> use to different design directories
[05-05-2005 04:30:07] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i believe
[05-05-2005 04:31:10] [#ezpublish] <xbit> err, TWO
[05-05-2005 04:32:03] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> i get that part, but do i then have to go through all the template files and manually translate??
[05-05-2005 04:33:23] [#ezpublish] <xbit> yep, if you have content in your templates (which i don't see why you have) you probably have to do it that way :)
[05-05-2005 04:34:15] [#ezpublish] <xbit> (well, i have content/text in some of my templates to but... :) )
[05-05-2005 04:34:21] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> hm... the site has just been set up. I chose norwegian as primary and english as additional
[05-05-2005 04:34:36] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> nothing has been "tampered" with
[05-05-2005 04:35:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> then everything should be in english, i thought...
[05-05-2005 04:36:07] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> that is right.. now i want it in norwegian. what do i do?`:-)
[05-05-2005 04:37:20] [#ezpublish] <xbit> http://www.ez.no/ez_publish/documentation/configuration/configuration/language_and_charset/how_to_setup_a_multilingual_site
[05-05-2005 04:37:23] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :)
[05-05-2005 04:38:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you can use the eZ publish translation features to abstract the english language text content in templates using the translation system constructs which can be dynamicly (by eZ publish autmaticly) replace all english with norwegan instead
[05-05-2005 04:38:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it is highly recomended
[05-05-2005 04:39:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ok, guys i'm crashing hard , my imaginary boss has been on me to get more sleep (4 hours every 36 is just not enough even for the kracker

[05-05-2005 04:41:17] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> where do i find this automatic translation thing?
[05-05-2005 04:42:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> do a google search for this set of keywords (change them to find more results): http://www.google.com/search?num=50&hl=en&lr=&safe=off&c2coff=1&q=site%3Aez.no+Translation+System&btnG=Search
[05-05-2005 04:42:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> might try multi-lingual keywords too
[05-05-2005 04:42:52] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> .
[05-05-2005 04:43:24] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i wonder if i should upgrade from 3.5.0 to 3.5.2, in the hope of getting paypal working...
[05-05-2005 04:43:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> honestly i know it exists, and i've read in detail about it but it's just too late to dig up all of that right now, create a new forum question and post 3-5 times to it, read 2-4 hours a day for a week of ez.no and you too can be an eZ kungfoo master ...
[05-05-2005 04:44:12] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i can only show you the door --morpheus
[05-05-2005 04:44:26] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hihi
[05-05-2005 04:45:08] [#ezpublish] <xbit> syntetisk: look in the translatsions dir, and look in template operators, on the docs at ez.no
[05-05-2005 04:45:20] [#ezpublish] <xbit> you'll see
[05-05-2005 04:49:12] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> hmm.. mabye this is not so easy to figure out if you don't code
[05-05-2005 04:50:25] [#ezpublish] <xbit> no, i don't think so
[05-05-2005 04:50:44] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> is the translation.ts the file where i'm supposed to do the translation?
[05-05-2005 04:51:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> sounds like you're close yeah :)
[05-05-2005 04:51:40] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i haven't used it, so i'm not 100% sure
[05-05-2005 04:52:20] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> but there are a lot of thanslation here, but why doesn't it apply on the site?
[05-05-2005 04:53:03] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i18n is the template operator...
[05-05-2005 04:53:17] [#ezpublish] <xbit> maybe the text isn't piped through that in the templates?
[05-05-2005 04:53:35] [#ezpublish] <xbit> maybe the siteaccess uses the wrong translation dir, or maybe you simply haven't cleared the cache?
[05-05-2005 04:53:39] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i don't know...
[05-05-2005 04:54:08] [#ezpublish] <syntetisk> hmm..
