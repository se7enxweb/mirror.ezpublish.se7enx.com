[12-09-2005 04:00:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> somehow the data i want to use for cache-block key is cached itself and thus pretty useless
[12-09-2005 04:07:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hi
[12-09-2005 04:27:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> {array($uri_string,$current_user.contentobject_id, ezpreference('forumlook'))|attribute(show)}
[12-09-2005 04:27:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> how comes that
[12-09-2005 04:28:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> thsis only yields 0,0,$forumlook
[12-09-2005 04:28:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> and $forumlook is cached eventhough its outside any cache-blocks
[12-09-2005 04:31:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> {cache-block keys=array($uri_string,$current_user.contentobject_id, ezpreference('forumlook'))}
[12-09-2005 04:31:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> that wont work either
[12-09-2005 04:31:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> (which is kinda obvious when you think about it)
[12-09-2005 04:57:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there a value in storing what posts a user has already read?
[12-09-2005 04:57:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> or does it just generate insane amounts of data in a busy forum?
[12-09-2005 05:02:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> btw: there's something wrong with ez.no/doc, posting a comment gives me redirection debug page
[12-09-2005 05:02:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think that should be there?
[12-09-2005 05:03:12] [#ezpublish] <@fh[eZ]> buz: comment propagated to the right person
[12-09-2005 05:03:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok
[12-09-2005 05:06:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> YEAH my caching works

[12-09-2005 05:14:58] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> buz: thought it was done with ajax initially :)
[12-09-2005 05:15:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> it is
[12-09-2005 05:15:11] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> oh!
[12-09-2005 05:15:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> (the threaded stuff anyway)
[12-09-2005 05:15:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> the different views themselves each use different templates though and do a full reload
[12-09-2005 05:15:39] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> I thought you must of load loaded the whole thing and used js to show/hide
[12-09-2005 05:15:48] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> very groovy
[12-09-2005 05:15:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> i could do that
[12-09-2005 05:15:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i dont see much point
[12-09-2005 05:16:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> tripples server load/dl time
[12-09-2005 05:16:44] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> is that using ezxml datatype?
[12-09-2005 05:18:07] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> minor bug, if you click the first post its reloads the whole thread as a child
[12-09-2005 05:18:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah i know
[12-09-2005 05:18:17] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> k
[12-09-2005 05:18:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i also know how to fix it
[12-09-2005 05:19:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's using ezxml with simplycode (like ez.no) i think i'll change it to bbcode though
[12-09-2005 05:19:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> or maybe it's using eztet, now that i think about it
[12-09-2005 05:20:10] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore_> the post has a picture which is why I asked
[12-09-2005 05:20:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's an image attribute actually

[12-09-2005 09:29:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> have any of you guys used MySQL Cluster ?
[12-09-2005 09:29:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> only realtime replication for backups
[12-09-2005 09:30:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> okay
[12-09-2005 09:30:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we need clustering ;)
[12-09-2005 09:32:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> afaik, it currently only works for dbs that fit in ram
[12-09-2005 09:32:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah that's what i've heard
[12-09-2005 09:32:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> so the use is somewhat limited i'd say
[12-09-2005 09:32:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we're proposing a hosting platform to a client
[12-09-2005 09:32:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, ram is not that expensive ;)
[12-09-2005 09:33:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's more limited by sockets than ram price
[12-09-2005 09:33:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> and 4gb sticks ARE expensive ;)
[12-09-2005 09:33:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yehq
[12-09-2005 09:33:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-09-2005 09:33:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> is the cluster for speed or reliability?
[12-09-2005 09:34:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> reliability
[12-09-2005 09:34:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think realtime replication and fail over is more useful then
[12-09-2005 09:34:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> and much more widely tested for sure
[12-09-2005 09:35:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course some would say reliability isnt exactly mysql's strength to begin with
[12-09-2005 09:35:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we don't have the choice to discuss that ;)
[12-09-2005 09:36:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> if you want that sort of reliability, you'll also want several dedicated upstreams
[12-09-2005 09:38:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> or even separated data centers for the truly paranoid
[12-09-2005 09:47:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we're gonna concentrate on hardware reliability first
[12-09-2005 09:47:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i think they're gonna forgive us the day an A bomb explodes in our datacenter ;)

[12-09-2005 09:49:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> a bombs i'm not so worried about, datacenter screwups much more so (they can, do and will happen)

[12-09-2005 09:52:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we didn't have any problem with them
[12-09-2005 09:53:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> those new sun niagara machines look damn neat
[12-09-2005 09:53:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> actually, we're hosting lots of scripts for that big client of us
[12-09-2005 09:53:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> including registration applications
[12-09-2005 09:53:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and this morning, our server went down due to a very cute system load of 650
[12-09-2005 09:53:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> wtf?
[12-09-2005 09:53:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so now they got the money for a better platform, dedicated
[12-09-2005 09:53:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and we're working on that
[12-09-2005 09:53:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> some deadlock, i think... the server is already handling MUCH more than it should
[12-09-2005 09:53:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> highest load i ever saw was about 15
[12-09-2005 09:54:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> mail + av + antispam + smtp + apache + prim dns + mysql
[12-09-2005 09:54:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lots of sites
[12-09-2005 09:54:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's funny when you get a 3 digits load :))
[12-09-2005 09:54:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> you should never have mail and web on the same machine ;)
[12-09-2005 09:55:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i know :)
[12-09-2005 09:55:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm not the sysadmin ;)

[12-09-2005 09:55:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe a tad ;)
[12-09-2005 09:56:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nice, 30K ADSL line test since yesterday morning on that interface
[12-09-2005 09:56:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and 12K registrations
[12-09-2005 09:57:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> is that my favorite el cheapo telco?

[12-09-2005 09:57:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> do you think you could hack their db so they stop calling me?

[12-09-2005 10:08:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> isn't it called JSP ? :)
[12-09-2005 10:08:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's the closest i think ;)
