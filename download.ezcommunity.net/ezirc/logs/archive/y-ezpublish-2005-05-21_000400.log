[05-20-2005 01:11:49] [#ezpublish] <Blore> and why is you can only select individual workflows and not work groups for the triggers?

[05-20-2005 01:49:39] [#ezpublish] <Bedlored> fh: is it possible to publish an object to two locations upon creation, one hardcoded id, and the other current location?
[05-20-2005 01:51:44] [#ezpublish] <fh> I think it is, but I'm not entirely sure how (I would guess hidden form parameters).. take a look at the input parameters of the edit view
[05-20-2005 01:51:48] [#ezpublish] <fh> or ask on the forum
[05-20-2005 01:52:06] [#ezpublish] <Bedlored> k, thanks

[05-20-2005 06:43:18] [#ezpublish] <freim> hi, I got a prob with the template overrides. I made an override called folder_line.tpl, but reconsidered and deleted it. The default override had the same filename, but didn't show up again after I deleted my custom one. How can I make it reappear in the Overrides for </node/view/line.tpl> template list?
[05-20-2005 06:43:42] [#ezpublish] <freim> this is with ezPub 3.5.2

[05-20-2005 07:41:36] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> SEAwolfx: how to set same overide template to several node id ?
[05-20-2005 07:41:54] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> SEAwolfx: must i add one override by node ? (with changing section name)
[05-20-2005 07:42:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i think this is done with the node_id option, which can be also set over the admin_interface when adding some new templates to the system.
[05-20-2005 07:43:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> add a new override template be using the admin_interface.
[05-20-2005 07:44:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> actually i dont know the right syntax within the override.append.ini.

[05-20-2005 15:13:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> was at the asian dub foundation concert last week. that's about as close to hiphop as i get ;)
[05-20-2005 15:13:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah, that's why i like sole's anticon crew so much more poetry than the uninteligent gangsta bounce
[05-20-2005 15:14:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh and some synthie stuff i like, too ;)
[05-20-2005 15:14:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> and of course, as i'm a child of the 90s, some of that horrible eurodance stuff ;)

[05-20-2005 15:31:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> its pathethic, really
[05-20-2005 15:34:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i tried it from teh same perspective before and got blew off (i know .. go figure)

[05-20-2005 15:35:50] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's just crushing when he refuses to return his changes to the community and uses excuses like time to never really help anyone else
[05-20-2005 15:36:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i couldn't find the original thread where i talked to him about it ( it was an overloaded thread which is in part why it was harder to find again)
[05-20-2005 15:37:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but then i guess i'm wrong to think others might like to contribute back
[05-20-2005 15:39:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well ... this is for sure the only reason for his behavior, i guess.
[05-20-2005 15:40:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> not necicarily, i mean i have been where he was several years ago, it seemed like later would work out .... it just is usualy too late to matter
[05-20-2005 15:41:31] [#ezpublish] <kracker> time is a crusher especialy if your going to be afraid of working with someone you don't know who could fill the gap, do what you don't care to, or have time for, or the desire ..
[05-20-2005 15:42:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed, full ack.
[05-20-2005 15:42:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i guess in the end i alwasy endup hitting myself in the face and saying if your so $(&($N#n smart do it yourself, but then ahhh i'm not the only one in this situation so perhapse it's not quite so bad for me
[05-20-2005 15:43:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe ;)
[05-20-2005 15:44:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i cna't live in fear that everything i say is going to be misinterpreted by people who don't care to try to relate or understand with my goals and ideals
[05-20-2005 15:44:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i know what i ment when said it, i might have hit the edge but it's very grounded
[05-20-2005 15:45:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> I would say you have another way to express your self as far as I can follow what you write.
[05-20-2005 15:45:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> some might misunderstand this style.
[05-20-2005 15:46:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i can relate to it so i know that others can too if they were to listen to what i say long enough you kinda get a feel for me, that you know me, in time, i become very predicatable but then so are you :P
[05-20-2005 15:46:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you have to look out of the glasses of an none native english speaking guy.
[05-20-2005 15:47:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this might be a factor i could imagine when people seems to get you wrong.
[05-20-2005 15:47:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> very true, it's posts like that that translate the worst, very bad
[05-20-2005 15:47:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's funny tho
[05-20-2005 15:48:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 15:48:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was talking about the idea for months now, and again just last night before the post hit the forums
[05-20-2005 15:50:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's just waiting to happen, the guy taunts us by offering to reciprocate but it's an empty offer

[05-20-2005 15:55:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> I would say: dont mind.
[05-20-2005 15:55:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wow, huh?
[05-20-2005 15:55:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you think i was being a dick?
[05-20-2005 15:56:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> no
[05-20-2005 15:56:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i thought that you were too direct.
[05-20-2005 15:56:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sure, how so ?
[05-20-2005 15:58:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> just read a few lines like: "I don't care about anything your trying to protect, I don't want what your trying to protect,"
[05-20-2005 15:58:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but i havent read the whole thread.
[05-20-2005 15:58:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sure
[05-20-2005 15:58:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> no your right, i said that several times over
[05-20-2005 15:59:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i was trying to 'fail'd attempt i think' to convince him that he was being overly protective and not very flexible with his sheltered sort-of-offer
[05-20-2005 15:59:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> his position being, i don't have time for you guys ...
[05-20-2005 16:00:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> my rebutal being, here let help us with that ...
[05-20-2005 16:00:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, you are right.
[05-20-2005 16:00:23] [#ezpublish] <kracker> his rebutal, i can't trust anyone with my data
[05-20-2005 16:00:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is not the true reason, believe me.
[05-20-2005 16:00:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> my rebutal, your data is irrelivent to people like me (but i'd die to protect your security)
[05-20-2005 16:00:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> he simply just dont want to share.
[05-20-2005 16:00:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> thats all.
[05-20-2005 16:01:13] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think so (at times when i loose faith in the members of this so called ocmmunity)
[05-20-2005 16:01:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> fuckers are all playing like cast members in the OC
[05-20-2005 16:01:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> OC?
[05-20-2005 16:01:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> opencommunity?
[05-20-2005 16:01:44] [#ezpublish] <kracker> fox tv show about snobby rich kids
[05-20-2005 16:01:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> american tv (soap oppra / trash tv for the drones)
[05-20-2005 16:02:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe
[05-20-2005 16:03:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i don't watch it but that doesn't mean i don't know what's not to like ...
[05-20-2005 16:03:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe ... same here. but sometimes its good to have a look on this to be reminded how the world runs.
[05-20-2005 16:03:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but you get this all the time in this subnet of the gnu / fsf community, theives, braggards and horders ...
[05-20-2005 16:04:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> see i'm not perfect and at times i simply do not give a .... but my heart is in the right place
[05-20-2005 16:05:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> honestly i can do what he did in time, but then it's not for me it's for all the newbs who need it more than i do
[05-20-2005 16:05:54] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the future of eZ publish is not continueing to build a monster stock eZ publish
[05-20-2005 16:06:00] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's in distrobutions
[05-20-2005 16:06:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well some points must be worked out like a wfms
[05-20-2005 16:06:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> just look around you, it's already happening by our betters (eZ systems (look at what bard is doing), xrow, paul b.)
[05-20-2005 16:06:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i would be interessted to make some ebuilds for ezpublish.
[05-20-2005 16:06:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> wfms?
[05-20-2005 16:07:05] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ebuilds?
[05-20-2005 16:07:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> workflow management systems
[05-20-2005 16:07:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ebuild is part of the gentoo-portage system.
[05-20-2005 16:07:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> absolutly, it might be incorrectly named but it's one of the things i have personal experiance in
[05-20-2005 16:07:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> package-management.,
[05-20-2005 16:07:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ahh i've seen some rpms of the latest eZ publish built before in my work ...
[05-20-2005 16:08:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> basicly a simialr concept, ebuild is better
[05-20-2005 16:08:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> mehh, rpms ugg
[05-20-2005 16:08:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kracker | >it's in distrobutions <- in the context of package-mangement?
[05-20-2005 16:08:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> possibly for maximum flexablity
[05-20-2005 16:08:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, indeed.
[05-20-2005 16:08:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ebuilds are prettycool.
[05-20-2005 16:08:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but drop in prebuilt solutions to start with
[05-20-2005 16:09:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> starting with stock is fairly intimidating for most
[05-20-2005 16:09:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> stock??
[05-20-2005 16:09:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's like here .. (drop) go imitate everything you've ever seen to get the functionality you want
[05-20-2005 16:09:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> is it a system?
[05-20-2005 16:09:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> STOCK eZ publish (like svn trunk)
[05-20-2005 16:09:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> a
[05-20-2005 16:09:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> what you get right now out of the box
[05-20-2005 16:10:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> is simply not enough
[05-20-2005 16:10:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but we are so moving in the right direction
[05-20-2005 16:10:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> with ebuilds you can use an svn.eclass to download the source during installation.
[05-20-2005 16:11:14] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i think we could really use a segnificant contribution to move us from moving forward to leaping forward
[05-20-2005 16:11:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sweet, it is gentoo i mean :)
[05-20-2005 16:11:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 16:12:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> should take a look on the eZ-rpms
[05-20-2005 16:13:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sry, what do you mean?
[05-20-2005 16:13:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> google didn't really help on "eZ-rpms"
[05-20-2005 16:13:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> kracker | >ahh i've seen some rpms of the latest eZ publish built before in my work ... <-
[05-20-2005 16:13:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> these rpms i meant.
[05-20-2005 16:14:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but its not so easy to maintain extensions.
[05-20-2005 16:14:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> cause config-files have to be changed.
[05-20-2005 16:14:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i hear ya now
[05-20-2005 16:14:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but hey .. this is also not really a problem, as we can path them
[05-20-2005 16:15:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> "merged" is better said.
[05-20-2005 16:15:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> some people are doing older builds, just found this : http://rpm.pbone.net/index.php3/stat/4/idpl/1897622/com/ezpublish-3.5.2-2mdk.noarch.rpm.html
[05-20-2005 16:16:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ezsvn can help in maintaining current extentions after installation
[05-20-2005 16:16:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i dont get the advantage of ezsvn?
[05-20-2005 16:17:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> its not a webclient as i have expected from it.
[05-20-2005 16:17:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> oh? it is a fetcher with an admin gui
[05-20-2005 16:18:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ahh .. ok, know i can hear you.
[05-20-2005 16:18:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> setup the extentions you want, setup the cron, or kick it manually it gets the latest sources and updates your local copy of the extention(s), design(s), etc...
[05-20-2005 16:18:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> to maintain the extensions from the admin_interface.
[05-20-2005 16:18:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's very functional and just waiting to be expanded into what you are thinking of ...
[05-20-2005 16:18:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> well at least what i'm thinking :)
[05-20-2005 16:18:46] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 16:19:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> select packages via admin gui with no direct programing (like current ezsvn)
[05-20-2005 16:19:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> gotta find the time
[05-20-2005 16:20:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yea .. time is the catchword.
[05-20-2005 16:20:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> always unfortunatly, see even i suck
[05-20-2005 16:20:47] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i wrote my ideas down, i didn't horde my inspiration
[05-20-2005 16:20:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 16:21:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, this is the right way. but what do you think about björn?
[05-20-2005 16:21:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ehh, screw my ideas i make myself look bad really bad
[05-20-2005 16:21:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> he's cool, kinda screws us with his horrible documentation
[05-20-2005 16:22:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> lol. true, true.
[05-20-2005 16:22:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but you gotta pimp support somehow i guess
[05-20-2005 16:22:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> that's me being fair, i've been red hot before but hey he gave us the code and if we want more we have to invest
[05-20-2005 16:23:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i want to stress that he also got some ideas not shared with the community like the content server or the mssql-extension.
[05-20-2005 16:23:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> exactly, no he's eleete to be sure, top notch
[05-20-2005 16:24:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> I think you only goes the right way between sharing and makeing money out of it,
[05-20-2005 16:24:46] [#ezpublish] <kracker> everyone deals with these situations differently, some clients could easily push me into his mind set of (time vs money)
[05-20-2005 16:24:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is the secret, i guess.
[05-20-2005 16:25:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it is a mystical ballance that must be maintained or your life span is short lived
[05-20-2005 16:27:08] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i don't want to make money per say off the community, i just want to be paid well for the work that i do so i can continue to do it (this way / lol / better than before / improve for everyone and myself?wince/)
[05-20-2005 16:27:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i can see how getting side money from simple support contracts can really free you from having to bash your head into your day job's desk
[05-20-2005 16:28:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 16:29:01] [#ezpublish] <kracker> so don't say much on the whole thing publicly (really till now), because if you think about it long enough it really does make sense from a sertain perspective and then ... there really isn't much to say
[05-20-2005 16:29:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, there are some ideas i keep in mind and waiting for the right time
[05-20-2005 16:29:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> cept, dude, these docs really are not enough! but you don't have to take my word for it, everyone else says so too!
[05-20-2005 16:30:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lol, i'm far to impacient (and a bad speller on no sleep)
[05-20-2005 16:30:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> np ;)
[05-20-2005 16:32:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well ... i currently configured vservers.
[05-20-2005 16:32:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> have also to set up snort ;)

[05-20-2005 16:48:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's gotta be hard talking with me though at timecase cause it's more like being the 3rd person in the conversation, i'm alreays talking to myself
[05-20-2005 16:48:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> lol ... i excited.
[05-20-2005 16:48:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> +am

[05-20-2005 16:49:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> agentbob: u use skype?
[05-20-2005 16:49:34] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yup, just aboutt ready
[05-20-2005 16:52:08] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> haven't used it yet
[05-20-2005 16:54:48] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> can we communicate telepathically with it yet?
[05-20-2005 16:54:56] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> or is that v2
[05-20-2005 16:55:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> http://www.skype.com/
[05-20-2005 16:59:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lol
[05-20-2005 16:59:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well communication works well to time.
[05-20-2005 17:43:16] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> but she's touching his chest now--he takes off her dress now--let me go
[05-20-2005 17:59:59] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 18:00:17] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> unfortunately need to dump ezpub :|
[05-20-2005 18:01:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> well .. easy ;)
[05-20-2005 18:01:27] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the backupscript should play the trick.
[05-20-2005 18:02:05] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i mean cheat on it with another sexy framework and then call it up and tell it it's not working out anymore
[05-20-2005 18:02:16] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> it's not ezpub it's me
[05-20-2005 18:02:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)
[05-20-2005 18:08:46] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm http://www.phpwact.org/
[05-20-2005 18:09:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah .. model view controller rocks ;)
[05-20-2005 18:10:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but ti be honest using only index.php vor all views is nearly the same approach. ;)
[05-20-2005 18:12:20] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah... i like ezpub framework but don't like all the extra bloat
[05-20-2005 18:12:45] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> crating ezpub classes/objects on top of php classes/objects is just... *shudders*
[05-20-2005 18:14:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so you are looking for a small MVC-solution?
[05-20-2005 18:16:48] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah.. where i can plugin stuff like DB_DataObject or Propel... use Smarty for templates, etc
[05-20-2005 18:19:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> agentbob: take a look on this: http://phrame.sourceforge.net/
[05-20-2005 18:20:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ;)

[05-20-2005 18:22:24] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hehehe
[05-20-2005 18:23:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you see this technology is proven as perfect that is completely closed.

[05-20-2005 18:24:33] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> except for lack of docs

[05-20-2005 18:25:19] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> yeah, the universe is self explanitory too, just need to take the time out to figure it out :P
[05-20-2005 18:25:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed.
[05-20-2005 21:20:33] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> my god there's too much

[05-20-2005 22:53:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> lol
[05-20-2005 22:53:35] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i used to actualy get into that mindset
[05-20-2005 22:54:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it would overwelm me (reall? no! go figure...) beening a teenager traumatized by a future that i could bearly begin to comprehend let alone look away, eyes dried out before dried out had a subliminal
[05-20-2005 22:55:32] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kickstart the appololypse inside, to whome do you confide, do what you do , don't fr33k, the dude abide(s)
[05-20-2005 22:56:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker> eyelids sottard open, can't look away, stuck in the middle of the fray, memories of a whole lifetime left hesitating on just what or how to say what you say, the crowd turns and walks away
[05-20-2005 22:58:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> night becomes day, nothing changes, everything stays the same way, realizeing i ... don't always play well with others if the others are on the other side of the line, use your imagination, get out of that bind, no need to become one of them, and then is been so . . . repetative and unamuzing actuallity more frustrating when we think your really abusing the predefined expectations and bounderies, ... fkemty
[05-20-2005 22:59:52] [#ezpublish] * kracker runs back into the brick wall of 9& 3/4

[05-20-2005 23:33:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it was a great visualizatoin of my imagination + theirs

[05-20-2005 23:35:11] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ya know i forget, it's very old
[05-20-2005 23:35:41] [#ezpublish] <kracker> one of the old iai crew hooked me up with the subliminals and i found it again after hours of hours of searching the net
[05-20-2005 23:36:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's not bad, it fits the hh2g theme fairly well, seems pro but i kinda doubt that for some reason .. *shrugs*
[05-20-2005 23:36:30] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i think i'm down to mojavi, prado, cake, or studs
[05-20-2005 23:36:40] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> sounds like his voice
[05-20-2005 23:36:52] [#ezpublish] <kracker> exactly
[05-20-2005 23:36:53] [#ezpublish] <kracker>  a friend of mine is writeing a
[05-20-2005 23:36:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> php5 frame work
[05-20-2005 23:37:33] [#ezpublish] <kracker> smarty + the other big name i think + his own custom framework implimentation
[05-20-2005 23:37:55] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it will be intersteting if it ever 'pawns / pans out'
[05-20-2005 23:38:24] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> http://p199.ezboard.com/f80sxchangewherecanifindthissong.showMessage?topicID=30.topic
[05-20-2005 23:38:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> bastard screwed me over to do it too, so i guess he's not much of a friend right now
[05-20-2005 23:38:38] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hahahahahahahahah "I've just joined and I can answer this as I just answered this for someone else not long ago. The song is called "Marvin" by Marvin. Hope this helped you."
[05-20-2005 23:38:49] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> ouch sorry to hear that
[05-20-2005 23:38:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i wrote it down and took a picture but i can't say i havent' forgotten before ...
[05-20-2005 23:39:07] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> i think for the project i'm workin on now i'm just going to use DB_DataObject and Savant and that's it
[05-20-2005 23:39:25] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ehh, i knew better ... he could be a bigger superstart than me anyway
[05-20-2005 23:39:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you'd like him you guys talk alike alot in the same notions
[05-20-2005 23:39:56] [#ezpublish] <kracker> he hates eZ too
[05-20-2005 23:40:10] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> http://www.gameamp.com/thingsthatrock/the_ghost_that_feeds-256.mp3
[05-20-2005 23:40:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> errum hate is a strong word, agressive dislike
[05-20-2005 23:40:55] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> in my framework searches i keep ending up at this guy revjim's website
[05-20-2005 23:40:58] [#ezpublish] <kracker> classese in classes gets him all antsy
[05-20-2005 23:40:59] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> the guy sounds totally like me
[05-20-2005 23:41:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> me shakes his head
[05-20-2005 23:41:21] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> agreed.... classes in classes PLUS templates in a template language
[05-20-2005 23:41:43] [#ezpublish] <kracker> it's hallarious being in the middle at times hearing both of you guys
[05-20-2005 23:41:59] [#ezpublish] <kracker> point for point, same
[05-20-2005 23:42:11] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> haha coo'
[05-20-2005 23:42:37] [#ezpublish] <kracker> one of you guys should write a really strong deep thurough article tearing into eZ so other people are warned ahead of time (we don't have one of those really)
[05-20-2005 23:43:30] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i mean we all have to choose, best to make informed choices with all the real life details documented a head of time (a list of things your not going to like after you get started ...)
[05-20-2005 23:43:42] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> hehehe yeah i'm on it.. i'm sure he is too... and if he's anything like me we'll both procrastinate it til a few years from now when someone else writes it
[05-20-2005 23:43:51] [#ezpublish] <agentbob> then we'll be like 'eh... don't need to write it anymore
[05-20-2005 23:44:02] [#ezpublish] <kracker> basicly the contradiction that was the problem
[05-20-2005 23:48:29] [#ezpublish] <kracker> could do anything, did very little, wanted all of the rewards, trying to bring along another fore the ride, dragging kicking and screaming away from waiting tables ... what a q1/2005
[05-20-2005 23:53:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> funny, he asked me not the other way around ...
