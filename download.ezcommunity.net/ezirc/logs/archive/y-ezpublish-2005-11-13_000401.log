[11-11-2005 02:19:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hi fh[eZ]
[11-11-2005 02:19:40] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> morning
[11-11-2005 02:24:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fh[eZ], i have a complex question... may I bother you for a short while ?
[11-11-2005 02:28:23] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> shoot..
[11-11-2005 02:28:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well... I have that project where the client has products (not shop, just product content objects) that are stored in a /products folder
[11-11-2005 02:29:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> then locations are assigned to them at different nodes in the website
[11-11-2005 02:29:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> like 2 or 3 for each of them
[11-11-2005 02:29:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so far it's ok, but now i have a problem with these products having subitems...
[11-11-2005 02:29:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> like subfolders with content and stuff
[11-11-2005 02:30:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> these children are used to generate a side navigation for these products, BUT if you have /product/foo/subitem1 and /other/path/to/foo, the location when browsing has to be /path/to/foo/subitem1
[11-11-2005 02:30:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> do you see my issue ? :)
[11-11-2005 02:32:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've got an event that's triggered when you create a subitem of a product. It creates additionnal locations for that subitem at each location of the product
[11-11-2005 02:32:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but then I have issues when a new location of the product is added, or when a product is deleted, and so on...
[11-11-2005 02:33:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> I have been thinking about something with url aliases, but without great success so far, since non redirect widlcard matching url forwarding seems broken
[11-11-2005 02:33:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> spam is finished ;)
[11-11-2005 02:34:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> suggestions frederik ?
[11-11-2005 02:39:49] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> hm... so you always want the user to be directed to the main location of the object?
[11-11-2005 02:40:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> on the contrary...
[11-11-2005 02:40:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i have to stay in the product location he's been browsing from
[11-11-2005 02:41:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> /products is never to be displayed
[11-11-2005 02:41:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but of course, I don't want to ask the user to create the additionnal locations for the subitems of a product... only for the product itself
[11-11-2005 02:41:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it has to be transparent
[11-11-2005 02:42:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so... either I try to do that with workflows that create the locations for the subitems automatically but 1. it's not easy 2. i feel like there is a strong risk of something going wrong

[11-11-2005 02:43:49] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> hmm
[11-11-2005 02:43:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> or I find another way... like url aliases (not working correctly so far) , or a custom module similar to content/view ...
[11-11-2005 02:44:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm using the viewed product location to generate all the navigation, so I really need it
[11-11-2005 02:44:26] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> url aliases will not work properly for you I think
[11-11-2005 02:44:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah ?

[11-11-2005 03:54:32] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they claim i didnt hand in all the docs for my assignment when the data was clearly attached
[11-11-2005 03:54:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol :(
[11-11-2005 03:54:56] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it did not have the magic .doc extension :P
[11-11-2005 03:55:02] [#ezpublish] <_buz> actually, it did
[11-11-2005 03:55:10] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but i can prove it was finished at the time hehe
[11-11-2005 03:55:27] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i had uploaded it to the uni fileserver a few hours before the deadline
[11-11-2005 03:55:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> not that it surprises me any if they dont know how to handle it
[11-11-2005 03:55:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and it shows up there
[11-11-2005 03:55:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i sent it again and politely insisted it aint my fault

[11-11-2005 04:00:50] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> and i'm back
[11-11-2005 04:01:02] [#ezpublish] <_buz> now if i could find a truly useful use for it ;)=
[11-11-2005 04:01:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, i have a web app used by hotline guys for a telco operator
[11-11-2005 04:01:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i could make $$$$$
[11-11-2005 04:01:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> they use it to run various tests provided by a partner on a phone line
[11-11-2005 04:01:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> modem synchronisation, etc, 4 tests
[11-11-2005 04:01:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> now they all run in parallel, with good looking results presentation, etc :)
[11-11-2005 04:01:42] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> well, I know as much as it uses JS(?)
[11-11-2005 04:01:54] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's essentially a fancy name for DHTML
[11-11-2005 04:02:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> errr
[11-11-2005 04:02:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not really :)
[11-11-2005 04:02:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> bundled with some HTTP requests
[11-11-2005 04:02:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, HTTP requests are the main point of AJAX...
[11-11-2005 04:02:41] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah but the main work it does is more dhtml than anything else
[11-11-2005 04:03:02] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but that's not new :=
[11-11-2005 04:03:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz> of course the lazy sucker i am, i usually just use the innerhtml stuff
[11-11-2005 04:03:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ajax without http requests is just dhtml
[11-11-2005 04:03:17] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I'm an html + css guy
[11-11-2005 04:03:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i can't figure out why i should go through the hassle of creating nodes in JS
[11-11-2005 04:03:27] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I know no JS, no AJAX, no php
[11-11-2005 04:03:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it really opens the door for amazing ergonomy in web apps...
[11-11-2005 04:03:39] [#ezpublish] <_buz> HTF do you use ezpublish then?
[11-11-2005 04:03:48] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> I'm a magican :p
[11-11-2005 04:03:50] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i wonder if we should go use Nomachine or some such outright
[11-11-2005 04:03:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> if you want to see a killer example _Rappy_, check the demo on http://www.zimbra.com/
[11-11-2005 04:03:55] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ajax is fancy name for coding a browser in javascript
[11-11-2005 04:04:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> if you want zrg...
[11-11-2005 04:04:19] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> but I DO know JSP, J2EE, JavaServlets and most stuff taht got to do with java
[11-11-2005 04:04:32] [#ezpublish] * _buz is waiting for the day when someone writes a browser in AJAX
[11-11-2005 04:04:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's just a normalized way of using stuff that was already there
[11-11-2005 04:04:35] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but it owns
[11-11-2005 04:04:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> its like coding a basic interpreter in postscript
[11-11-2005 04:05:02] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> we got a couple og guys getting down with Ruby on Rails, that seems rahter neat
[11-11-2005 04:05:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> which has been done too if i remember correctly :P
[11-11-2005 04:05:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> there was actually that wacko that wrote a HTTPd in postscript
[11-11-2005 04:05:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i have been very interested in ruby
[11-11-2005 04:05:27] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i like python better
[11-11-2005 04:05:35] [#ezpublish] <_buz> php is a sucky language when you get down to it
[11-11-2005 04:05:35] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> Katana`, that page is made with AJAX?
[11-11-2005 04:05:45] [#ezpublish] <_buz> _Rappy_: the webapp is
[11-11-2005 04:06:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but i really wonder if it wouldnt be easier to simply use remote desktop stuff to build something like that
[11-11-2005 04:07:12] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> so what do you guys use AJAX for?
[11-11-2005 04:07:24] [#ezpublish] <_buz> now of course, if someone wanted to do a killer app: write an xserver that renders to AJAX...
[11-11-2005 04:07:32] [#ezpublish] * _buz runs off to patent that
[11-11-2005 04:08:24] [#ezpublish] <_Rappy_> got a good page where I can read about AJAX? Just the overview
[11-11-2005 04:10:11] [#ezpublish] * _buz is waiting for a good office in the browser
[11-11-2005 04:10:22] [#ezpublish] * zrg once wrote a compiler for a turing machine :P
[11-11-2005 04:10:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> why ON EARTH should office be run in browser?
[11-11-2005 04:11:54] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i understand the need for server-centeric apps but clearly a web browser is the worst client program for such?
[11-11-2005 04:12:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> so that we can ship machines that basically have linux plus firefox installed
[11-11-2005 04:12:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> zrg: seriously, have a look at zimbra :)
[11-11-2005 04:12:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> forget about a distro
[11-11-2005 04:12:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i just did
[11-11-2005 04:12:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you feel like you're using a standard GUI email client
[11-11-2005 04:12:32] [#ezpublish] <_buz> the distro is on the server
[11-11-2005 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's the lightest client ever (as opposed to heavy client)
[11-11-2005 04:12:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no software install required, no maintenance cost
[11-11-2005 04:12:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> NOTHING
[11-11-2005 04:13:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> just a bloody browser :)
[11-11-2005 04:13:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz> exactly
[11-11-2005 04:13:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that's the point...
[11-11-2005 04:13:11] [#ezpublish] <_buz> otoh, it wastes bandwidth in a way
[11-11-2005 04:13:12] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nice eye candy, painfully slow, probably very unreliable
[11-11-2005 04:13:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> zrg: yes, very unreliable, that's why google uses it for gmail
[11-11-2005 04:13:33] [#ezpublish] <_buz> actually the lightest client would likely be telnet
[11-11-2005 04:13:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> everybody knows gmail never works
[11-11-2005 04:13:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the interface crashes, errors everywhere... oh no wait, it's totally reliable ! :)
[11-11-2005 04:13:57] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it actually breaks more often than they would wnt you to believe
[11-11-2005 04:14:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but thats aproblem with their backend
[11-11-2005 04:14:08] [#ezpublish] <_buz> not with AJAX
[11-11-2005 04:14:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm sure that with time, lots of JS widgets will be released that you can use with AJAX apps
[11-11-2005 04:14:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah but a good ide is still missing
[11-11-2005 04:14:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lists, trees, etc etc... everything you need to build a real UI
[11-11-2005 04:14:45] [#ezpublish] <_buz> that stuff is out there
[11-11-2005 04:14:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that's gonna come too...
[11-11-2005 04:14:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> in a unified way i mean ;)
[11-11-2005 04:14:54] [#ezpublish] <_buz> theres a giant widget library somewhere at SF
[11-11-2005 04:14:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> really ?
[11-11-2005 04:15:07] [#ezpublish] <_buz> cant remember its name
[11-11-2005 04:15:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but has trees, registers the whole shebang
[11-11-2005 04:15:36] [#ezpublish] <zrg> actually breaks now and then, i use it tho. gmail isnt bad
[11-11-2005 04:16:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i hate webmail

[11-11-2005 07:48:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> has anyone used the (reverse_)related_objects fetches?
[11-11-2005 07:58:07] [#ezpublish] <_buz> a great many, likely
[11-11-2005 07:58:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi _buz
[11-11-2005 07:58:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> is there a way to just get the related objs of an obj of one single class type ?
[11-11-2005 07:59:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> i.e. only "opinions" related to a poll obj
[11-11-2005 07:59:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yes
[11-11-2005 07:59:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok _buz cough it up ;)
[11-11-2005 07:59:22] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i think 3.7 has that
[11-11-2005 07:59:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> docs are not clear on that
[11-11-2005 07:59:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> otherwise you can try using my filter_related operator in the contribs
[11-11-2005 07:59:41] [#ezpublish] <_buz> google the forum
[11-11-2005 08:01:10] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> uh, I think I'll go for your operator if it cuts the cheese
[11-11-2005 08:04:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> seems I cannot find anything about 3.7 doing that .. ach
[11-11-2005 08:09:23] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> _buz: you haven't used a class filter yourself with related objs ?
[11-11-2005 08:09:35] [#ezpublish] <_buz> not yet
[11-11-2005 08:09:52] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I also wonder why can I only pass an obj id instead of a node id
[11-11-2005 08:10:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> cause related objects are related to objects not nodes, duuuh

[11-11-2005 08:37:26] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur would really like to avoid cycling
[11-11-2005 08:37:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> through the resultset I mean
[11-11-2005 08:50:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> wanna see my nice ajax interface dudes ? :)
[11-11-2005 08:50:57] [#ezpublish] <zrg> bring it out ;)
[11-11-2005 08:51:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> sure Katana`

[11-11-2005 08:51:40] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur too especially if it refers to the default admin :P
[11-11-2005 08:52:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lemme puit it in test mode
[11-11-2005 08:52:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum...
[11-11-2005 08:52:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we'll have to synchronize ourselves if you wanna see something decent ;)

[11-11-2005 08:53:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> enter the phone number 0134103061 in the box and submit
[11-11-2005 08:53:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, it's in test mode since i don't have a test number
[11-11-2005 08:54:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and the last test is in 2 steps, i have to switch steps manually in the script ;)
[11-11-2005 08:54:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> so tell me once you have the counter in the right box
[11-11-2005 08:54:31] [#ezpublish] <zrg> uh.. something is wrong with language..
[11-11-2005 08:54:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yes it's in french :)
[11-11-2005 08:54:50] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah :)
[11-11-2005 08:55:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's for french tech support
[11-11-2005 08:55:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> each box represents the result of a technical test of an ADSL connection
[11-11-2005 08:55:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok.. some popup and BAS OK
[11-11-2005 08:55:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> modem ping, port synchronisation...
[11-11-2005 08:55:49] [#ezpublish] <zrg> something a la selt a la 5 minutes
[11-11-2005 08:55:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you will get a confirmation box that asks "the synchronisation test fails, do you wanna start the SELT test ? beware, that test lasts 5 minutes"
[11-11-2005 08:55:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that one :p
[11-11-2005 08:56:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hit okay
[11-11-2005 08:56:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> after a short while, you'll get a counter in the SELT box
[11-11-2005 08:56:25] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok, now it has uploaded my hd content or what? :)
[11-11-2005 08:56:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 08:56:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> actually
[11-11-2005 08:56:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that test is ran in 2 ops
[11-11-2005 08:56:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> yes, counts.. what?
[11-11-2005 08:56:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the first sends the requests
[11-11-2005 08:56:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> then 5 minutes later, the interface requests the result
[11-11-2005 08:57:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's gonna count until 5:00 (roughly)
[11-11-2005 08:57:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but since i'm cheating i'm gonna enable the result now :)
[11-11-2005 08:57:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> should change soon
[11-11-2005 08:57:27] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah, to be god, if only for minute
[11-11-2005 08:57:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hum my result is not showing :)
[11-11-2005 08:57:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it should ...
[11-11-2005 08:58:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> something is 210m and etat igle open
[11-11-2005 08:58:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeha
[11-11-2005 08:58:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it tells you about the ADSL line length, diameter
[11-11-2005 08:58:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and in red what the tech guy should answer to the complaining customer ;)
[11-11-2005 08:58:47] [#ezpublish] <zrg> my adsl??
[11-11-2005 08:58:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not yours
[11-11-2005 08:59:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> just imagine you're a poor ADSL techn support guy talking on the phone with a client
[11-11-2005 08:59:05] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah.. for a moment i thought you were real good :D
[11-11-2005 08:59:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and the you answer "well, dude, nothing's wrong with your line, double check your modem"
[11-11-2005 08:59:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[11-11-2005 08:59:35] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the thought fills me with chills and need to chew through my veins :P
[11-11-2005 08:59:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hehehe
[11-11-2005 09:00:41] [#ezpublish] <zrg> they usually go to braindead mode when you try to explain you cant reboot windows :P
[11-11-2005 09:00:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 09:01:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> actually not so bad, i've seen a tech who successfully set up ubuntu for adsl.. butthen it was tech of course, not phone girl

[11-11-2005 13:07:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> me ? err no :)
[11-11-2005 13:07:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> definitely not
[11-11-2005 13:07:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm reviewing various DHTML widgets toolkits
[11-11-2005 13:07:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and this one is AMAZING
[11-11-2005 13:08:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and very good demo too ;)
[11-11-2005 13:08:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> mix that with AJAX and hmmmmmm :)
[11-11-2005 13:08:19] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> looks like so ... ok, you can easily adapt it for eZ within monday ;)
[11-11-2005 13:08:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[11-11-2005 13:08:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it would rock though...
[11-11-2005 13:09:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it even has documentation :)
[11-11-2005 13:09:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it seems that the widgets used in Zimbra are publicly available as well
[11-11-2005 13:09:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i love the interface of that app...
[11-11-2005 13:09:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> noooo ... DOCUMENTATION???
[11-11-2005 13:09:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> lol
[11-11-2005 13:10:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 13:11:12] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well ......
[11-11-2005 13:11:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I could love to have the time to make an user site with eZ and that
[11-11-2005 13:11:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it would be for the admin interface imho
[11-11-2005 13:12:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> not necessarily ;)
[11-11-2005 13:12:33] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> but yes, k00l
[11-11-2005 13:12:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> on a user site it would be less MS Windows like ;)
[11-11-2005 13:14:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> one of the designers I work with has made his site a-la-old-mac-style
[11-11-2005 13:14:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 13:14:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> if I could only remember the url ...
[11-11-2005 13:15:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> he used flash, but it looks like a pc , with windows and stuff. it even has a pong game ;)
[11-11-2005 13:15:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> heheh :)
[11-11-2005 13:18:03] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> Katana`: what brings you here at this hour? I am still at work so I think I can be justified .... I suppose you're home, don't you have enough of a work-related channel? ;)
[11-11-2005 13:18:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm always on #ezpublish if i'm on irc ;)
[11-11-2005 13:18:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and i was working actually
[11-11-2005 13:20:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> we know no night :P
[11-11-2005 13:21:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> close deadline, as far as i'm concerned :)
[11-11-2005 13:21:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but i never stop thinking about dev ;)
[11-11-2005 13:22:12] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> same here ...
[11-11-2005 13:22:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and I like that
[11-11-2005 13:25:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> i think i can agree, though i'd prefer to be more on analisys and less on programming
[11-11-2005 13:25:08] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm on both so...
[11-11-2005 13:26:11] [#ezpublish] <_buz> katana is often around at such times no
[11-11-2005 13:26:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> if i'm on irc i'm on the channel :)
[11-11-2005 13:26:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ;)
[11-11-2005 13:27:11] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> luckily i remembred i had something in the office fridge
[11-11-2005 13:27:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[11-11-2005 13:27:22] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i just came back from the kitchen
[11-11-2005 13:27:26] [#ezpublish] <_buz> was cooking with my gf
[11-11-2005 13:27:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 13:29:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> has anyone seen that nokia 770 linux tablet pc
[11-11-2005 13:29:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> wholemeal bread and "bresaola" here
[11-11-2005 13:29:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yum
[11-11-2005 13:29:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> pizza here...
[11-11-2005 13:29:49] [#ezpublish] <_buz> proper bread is one thing i miss the soonest when away from central europe
[11-11-2005 13:29:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> electrical plates are dead, only oven is left :)
[11-11-2005 13:30:00] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> nope, i was considering to buy the motorola v3x .... it has only 5 mbs o base memory, but what the hell.
[11-11-2005 13:30:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> nah i want the nokia e61 when it arrives
[11-11-2005 13:30:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but as for the tablet, i wonder what handwriting recognition they use
[11-11-2005 13:30:48] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and where to get it
[11-11-2005 13:31:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> there are a few nifty windows mobile 5 phones in the pipeline but there's NFW i'm gonna use a phone with win on it
[11-11-2005 13:36:21] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> e61 ?
[11-11-2005 13:36:26] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> what's that?
[11-11-2005 13:36:34] [#ezpublish] <_buz> google for nokia e61
[11-11-2005 13:36:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> basically, it's nokia's blackberry clone
[11-11-2005 13:36:48] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but it comes with wlan and SIP support!
[11-11-2005 13:36:57] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and should be at about 400? WITHOUT contract
[11-11-2005 13:36:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well _buz I am not fond of motorolas but they will be launching it at a discount .... so maybe I'll give it a try. personally, I am all for nokias
[11-11-2005 13:37:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> the motorola q looks nifty but its stinking windows mobile as well
[11-11-2005 13:37:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> the bendy one with zeiss lenses looks nifty (although still a poor attempt at cloning a real digital camera)
[11-11-2005 13:37:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i also wonder when the successor to the nokia 9300 will arrive
[11-11-2005 13:38:02] [#ezpublish] <_buz> these days, they write zeiss on every piece of shit you know
[11-11-2005 13:38:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> even some of those ultra crappy HP cams come with zeiss lenses
[11-11-2005 13:40:28] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> too bad for zeiss
[11-11-2005 13:40:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah they've become greedy it seems
[11-11-2005 13:40:58] [#ezpublish] * Sulfur is splatting mosquitoes with his nifty free Ubuntu 5.10 packed CDs :))
[11-11-2005 13:41:39] [#ezpublish] <_buz> lol
[11-11-2005 13:41:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i prefer kubuntu
[11-11-2005 13:41:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-11-2005 13:41:59] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i'm waiting for the 6.04 release and kubuntu shipit cd
[11-11-2005 13:43:18] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I am rather k-agnostic at the moment ... I would try both no problem
[11-11-2005 13:43:26] [#ezpublish] <_buz> you can
[11-11-2005 13:43:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> apt-get install kubuntu-desktop once ubuntu is running and you get both
[11-11-2005 13:43:42] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> oh, the nice sound of splatting bugs with a free , quality gift
[11-11-2005 13:43:50] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they say ubuntu's gnome support is better but i can't stand gnome
[11-11-2005 13:44:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I can say without fear of diminisment that I am rather a luser when it comes to desktops. gnome, kde ... as long as they run my Zend and my shell, I am fine :)
[11-11-2005 13:45:07] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> true, the conf utilities for gnome are a pain
[11-11-2005 13:45:28] [#ezpublish] <_buz> kde seems much more integrated to me
[11-11-2005 13:45:33] [#ezpublish] <_buz> all around better architecture for sure
[11-11-2005 13:45:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and not as badly dumbed down (quite the opposite in many people's view)
[11-11-2005 13:46:04] [#ezpublish] * nnn0 use SimplyMEPIS with KDE
[11-11-2005 13:46:09] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i love that distro
[11-11-2005 13:46:11] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-11-2005 13:46:18] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i tried it once
[11-11-2005 13:46:25] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it quit working after the first apt-get upgrade
[11-11-2005 13:46:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> actually - i'm running Enlightenment as window manager over KDE
[11-11-2005 13:46:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> then i came across kubuntu way back in it's first beta stage and i stuck to it
[11-11-2005 13:46:47] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ehehe
[11-11-2005 13:46:53] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> k

[11-11-2005 14:55:40] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hehe
[11-11-2005 15:02:26] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> whats that fun? ;)
[11-11-2005 15:03:04] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hi, btw
[11-11-2005 15:03:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> buzzword of the day: ajax
[11-11-2005 15:05:50] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> or asynchronous javascript and xml
[11-11-2005 15:06:10] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> yeah, thats funny, I have liqud with the same name for washing the dishes
[11-11-2005 15:06:18] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[11-11-2005 15:06:20] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hehe
[11-11-2005 15:06:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> when i was younger i supported a footballteam with that name
[11-11-2005 15:07:21] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> that was very good football team
[11-11-2005 15:07:30] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> actually ! the lokal team is called Ajaks :D
[11-11-2005 15:07:34] [#ezpublish] * _buz hates football
[11-11-2005 15:07:51] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i can play it, but it shouldn't be on tv :D
[11-11-2005 15:07:59] [#ezpublish] <_buz> really all sorts of sport involving the chasing of some sort of item
[11-11-2005 15:08:07] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> and they are definitly not that good like our AJAX ;)
[11-11-2005 15:08:15] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-11-2005 15:09:16] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> have any of you made a contact form with multiple recipients ?
[11-11-2005 15:09:16] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> buz do you like any sports? or you are aware because of coding in AJAX ;)
[11-11-2005 15:09:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> let's say i go to the gym about 3 times a week
[11-11-2005 15:09:42] [#ezpublish] <_buz> "like" is the wrong word though
[11-11-2005 15:09:55] [#ezpublish] <_buz> actually, i'd love to go scuba diving but it's $$$
[11-11-2005 15:10:01] [#ezpublish] <_buz> same for riding fast motorbikes
[11-11-2005 15:10:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> so as far as "conventional" sports go, i probably dont like them
[11-11-2005 15:10:32] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i imagine kite surfing to be quite a lot of fun too
[11-11-2005 15:10:34] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> ah, I see you like high adrenaline ;)
[11-11-2005 15:10:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz> mhh motorbikes only very rarely gave me adrenaline
[11-11-2005 15:11:04] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (usually the nr 1 factor were the cops ;
[11-11-2005 15:11:05] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> depends on bikes ;)
[11-11-2005 15:11:14] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> try without good breaks
[11-11-2005 15:11:19] [#ezpublish] <_buz> well my licence was limited to 125ccm
[11-11-2005 15:11:25] [#ezpublish] <_buz> oh i had LOUSY breaks on that old honda
[11-11-2005 15:11:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> a wonder i survived that beast, really
[11-11-2005 15:12:11] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but a decent bike easily runs 7000EUR
[11-11-2005 15:12:27] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (or 15000EUR if you want a new 1300CCM monster)
[11-11-2005 15:12:29] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I prefere cars
[11-11-2005 15:12:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> well a car that matches a 7000EUR bike in performance is more like 100000EUR
[11-11-2005 15:13:00] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and even then, driving a bike is muuuuch more direct
[11-11-2005 15:13:14] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I dont want to compare, generally I prefere cars,
[11-11-2005 15:13:30] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they are safer, that's true
[11-11-2005 15:13:37] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but bikes are more fun to drive
[11-11-2005 15:14:52] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> maybe, but with bikes is usually related sub-cultutre, my neighbour joined outlaws
[11-11-2005 15:15:00] [#ezpublish] <_buz> nah
[11-11-2005 15:15:02] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> thats also fun
[11-11-2005 15:15:13] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i'd never join a bike club
[11-11-2005 15:15:37] [#ezpublish] <_buz> bike is about freedom, not driving in groups and having to figure out where the group wants to go
[11-11-2005 15:15:39] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> crazy weird guys
[11-11-2005 15:16:01] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> he driving mostly alone, but from time to time they organize events
[11-11-2005 15:16:22] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> drinking whole night, talking about baikes, bla bl
[11-11-2005 15:16:24] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> a
[11-11-2005 15:16:34] [#ezpublish] <_buz> its much the same like we do here
[11-11-2005 15:16:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> only we dont talk about bikes, in general ;)
[11-11-2005 15:16:46] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe, true
[11-11-2005 15:16:58] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and drinking the whole night is always a good thing (tm)
[11-11-2005 15:17:28] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> do you have some beers, or not, I would like to test GT tonight ;)
[11-11-2005 15:17:37] [#ezpublish] <_buz> GT?
[11-11-2005 15:17:41] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> gin&tonic
[11-11-2005 15:17:47] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> with ice and limon
[11-11-2005 15:17:47] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i have beers
[11-11-2005 15:18:07] [#ezpublish] <_buz> just bought one of those plastic boxes with 10 bottles in it
[11-11-2005 15:18:09] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> but not bannana beers?
[11-11-2005 15:18:12] [#ezpublish] <_buz> NOOOO

[11-11-2005 15:18:16] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe :)
[11-11-2005 15:18:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i actually threw away the last three of those
[11-11-2005 15:18:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and one is already empty in front of me
[11-11-2005 15:18:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> sucks
[11-11-2005 15:18:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> less than drinking that piss
[11-11-2005 15:19:28] [#ezpublish] * _buz opens next bottle
[11-11-2005 15:19:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> cheers

[11-11-2005 15:20:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i'm optimistic but you never know with those weird exams
[11-11-2005 15:21:20] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have busy weekend, starting at 8 tomorrow
[11-11-2005 15:21:51] [#ezpublish] <_buz> mine is busy too
[11-11-2005 15:22:01] [#ezpublish] <_buz> busy drinking all sorts of alcoholic beverages that is
[11-11-2005 15:22:26] [#ezpublish] <_buz> either because i passed the exams or because i didn't
[11-11-2005 15:22:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> both gives plenty reasons to get piss drunk
[11-11-2005 15:24:00] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> so congratz
[11-11-2005 15:24:13] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> you have to celebrate ;)
[11-11-2005 15:24:13] [#ezpublish] <_buz> wait for that until tomorrow ;)
[11-11-2005 15:24:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah either celebrate or forget ;)
[11-11-2005 15:33:00] [#ezpublish] <_buz> so how's your G&T?
[11-11-2005 15:33:26] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> warm, dont have ice
[11-11-2005 15:33:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> iiiiew
[11-11-2005 15:33:41] [#ezpublish] <_buz> that reminds me of asia though
[11-11-2005 15:33:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz> usually i had to drink without ice so not have contaminated water in them
[11-11-2005 15:34:25] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> but warm gt is not trully gt
[11-11-2005 15:34:42] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i cant stand Gin so i wouldnt care for cold one, either
[11-11-2005 15:36:25] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> this funy, every one here drinks vodka, I'm aware of this alcohole
[11-11-2005 15:36:35] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i dont like vodka, either
[11-11-2005 15:36:38] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> me too
[11-11-2005 15:36:49] [#ezpublish] <_buz> about the only strong drink i like is GOOD single malt  whisky
[11-11-2005 15:36:52] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but i cant afford that one
[11-11-2005 15:36:57] [#ezpublish] <_buz> so i stick to beer and red wine
[11-11-2005 15:37:15] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> good beer is ok, how about swiss beers?
[11-11-2005 15:37:32] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> which one is good and enough famous that I can buy it here?
[11-11-2005 15:37:39] [#ezpublish] <_buz> these days, if you stay away from the mainstream, plenty of good ones
[11-11-2005 15:37:53] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i doubt it, the famous ones are all just slightly better than the heineken crap
[11-11-2005 15:38:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i cant ever understand why heineken is so successful
[11-11-2005 15:38:28] [#ezpublish] <_buz> truly disgusting stuff
[11-11-2005 15:38:33] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> what is famouse other swiss beer
[11-11-2005 15:38:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> feldschlösschen
[11-11-2005 15:38:48] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> lol
[11-11-2005 15:38:59] [#ezpublish] <_buz> http://www.feldschlosschen.ch/
[11-11-2005 15:39:06] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i think it's owned by carlsberg this days
[11-11-2005 15:39:20] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i dont particularly like it
[11-11-2005 15:39:40] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's drinkable, but no better than the 0.40EUR beer we get from poland ;)
[11-11-2005 15:40:00] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Which one do you like ?
[11-11-2005 15:40:05] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> We have a lot of good beers
[11-11-2005 15:40:29] [#ezpublish] <_buz> http://www.eichhof.ch/1/3/53/54/56/57.asp
[11-11-2005 15:41:00] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have never seen
[11-11-2005 15:41:11] [#ezpublish] <_buz> mid sized brewery
[11-11-2005 15:41:17] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i dont think they really export much
[11-11-2005 15:41:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's one of those unfiltered beers
[11-11-2005 15:41:26] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i much prefer those
[11-11-2005 15:41:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> ?ywiec -> http://www.zywiec.pl
[11-11-2005 15:41:55] [#ezpublish] <_buz> city page?
[11-11-2005 15:42:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> as for the big international beers, corona is one of the few ones i actually like
[11-11-2005 15:42:36] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> http://www.zywiec.com.pl/flash/index.html
[11-11-2005 15:42:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and the phillipine variety of san miguel is quite decent to
[11-11-2005 15:42:41] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> that is correct
[11-11-2005 15:43:32] [#ezpublish] <_buz> cool project
[11-11-2005 15:43:47] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe yeah, and very good beer
[11-11-2005 15:44:58] [#ezpublish] <_buz> never seen it
[11-11-2005 15:45:20] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> you can't buy polish beers in swiss?
[11-11-2005 15:45:34] [#ezpublish] <_buz> next time i'm in that 400 brands of beer store nearby i'll look for it
[11-11-2005 15:45:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they have beer from all over
[11-11-2005 15:45:53] [#ezpublish] <_buz> well much of the cheap discount beer comes from poland i think ;)
[11-11-2005 15:46:01] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's actually not bad at all
[11-11-2005 15:46:13] [#ezpublish] <_buz> not as good as really good beer but definitely drinkable and better than heineken ;)
[11-11-2005 15:46:30] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> try Zywiec, Warka, Okocim, Tyskie
[11-11-2005 15:46:44] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> from the best for me
[11-11-2005 15:46:53] [#ezpublish] <_buz> *makesnote*
[11-11-2005 15:47:10] [#ezpublish] <_buz> is budvar in poland? or former czechoslovakia?
[11-11-2005 15:47:58] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hmm, rather not
[11-11-2005 15:48:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz> czech republic
[11-11-2005 15:48:07] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> probadly
[11-11-2005 15:48:12] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i think it's overrated
[11-11-2005 15:48:20] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but many claim it to be one of the best beers in the world
[11-11-2005 15:48:20] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Zloty Bazant
[11-11-2005 15:49:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> http://selectitaly.com/index.php
[11-11-2005 15:49:32] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> nice site
[11-11-2005 15:51:49] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Carlsberg is probadly the best beer on the world ;)
[11-11-2005 15:51:59] [#ezpublish] <_buz> YE FUCKING GODS
[11-11-2005 15:52:06] [#ezpublish] <_buz> carlsberg is just slightly better than heineken
[11-11-2005 15:52:11] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe
[11-11-2005 15:52:30] [#ezpublish] <_buz> to be honest, the beer i hate the most is guiness
[11-11-2005 15:52:38] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i cant understand why anyone would drink THAT
[11-11-2005 15:52:46] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> how fast they can make beer? ;) Very fasy, accualy making good beer needs some time
[11-11-2005 15:52:53] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah
[11-11-2005 15:53:39] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have never been in Holland as turist but I heard about some places where you can drink really good traditional beer
[11-11-2005 15:53:56] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah, places where they dont serve heineken ;)
[11-11-2005 15:54:02] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe
[11-11-2005 15:54:04] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but in holland, there's other things to do than drink beer ;)
[11-11-2005 15:54:13] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> yeah smoke
[11-11-2005 15:54:20] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and lots of it
[11-11-2005 15:54:30] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> but this part of my life is behind me
[11-11-2005 15:54:38] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> ;)
[11-11-2005 15:54:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i only rarely smoke these days
[11-11-2005 15:54:47] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but it's still fun ;)
[11-11-2005 15:55:26] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> this is of course not allowed in CH right
[11-11-2005 15:55:27] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> ?
[11-11-2005 15:57:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> actually, up until 2003 the cops were quite uninterested
[11-11-2005 15:57:52] [#ezpublish] <_buz> there were many shops selling grass very openly
[11-11-2005 15:57:59] [#ezpublish] <_buz> ever since, there's been a lot of crack down
[11-11-2005 15:58:15] [#ezpublish] <_buz> for consumers, far and by large, nobody cares but for shops the business has gotten though
[11-11-2005 15:58:17] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> here is highly not allwed
[11-11-2005 15:58:25] [#ezpublish] <_buz> well there's a hole in the law
[11-11-2005 15:58:35] [#ezpublish] <_buz> hemp can be sold but NOT if its a drug
[11-11-2005 15:58:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> of course that definition is highly dependent on the judge
[11-11-2005 15:58:46] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> same here, it was but they fixed it
[11-11-2005 15:58:54] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but just for possession, they wont throw you into jail
[11-11-2005 15:59:04] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> no longer here
[11-11-2005 15:59:06] [#ezpublish] <_buz> small fine and thats it, if you cant talk yourself out of it
[11-11-2005 15:59:15] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> if you have then you will have process
[11-11-2005 15:59:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (most cops dont care enough to fill out the paper work, so they just walk past you)
[11-11-2005 15:59:51] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> and if you sell teenagers belowe 18 then you are is double troubles
[11-11-2005 16:00:18] [#ezpublish] <_buz> there's not so much the justice can do
[11-11-2005 16:00:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they can fine you or maybe even start a trial but unless you've been peddling tons of it, you usually wont go to jail
[11-11-2005 16:01:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz> every now and then, there's even talk about legalizing it (tho this year, it's gotten further from it)
[11-11-2005 16:02:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz> of course church and related groups are strictly against legalization
[11-11-2005 16:02:27] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> here we have poland A and poland B
[11-11-2005 16:02:36] [#ezpublish] <_buz> ?
[11-11-2005 16:03:04] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> A is 100% catolic, old-school, conserwative and poland B liberal, with young new generation
[11-11-2005 16:03:15] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yeah we have much of that divide
[11-11-2005 16:03:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> not so extreme as in many other countries though
[11-11-2005 16:03:38] [#ezpublish] * _buz is STRONG liberal, let the market decide - economist
[11-11-2005 16:03:56] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> yeahm but we had President vote 1 month ago, and this show how poland is divided
[11-11-2005 16:04:09] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> me too
[11-11-2005 16:04:19] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I had the same opnions
[11-11-2005 16:04:30] [#ezpublish] <_buz> oh yeah i read about in "the economist" but i forgot what happened ;)
[11-11-2005 16:04:39] [#ezpublish] <_buz> which one won?
[11-11-2005 16:04:42] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> and I belive that market should be independed, and live on own rules
[11-11-2005 16:04:51] [#ezpublish] <_buz> for the most part, it would be better
[11-11-2005 16:04:58] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Lech Kaczynski - social
[11-11-2005 16:05:01] [#ezpublish] <_buz> there are some areas where the law should intervene though
[11-11-2005 16:05:10] [#ezpublish] <_buz> whereas social is liberal? or more old school communist?
[11-11-2005 16:05:28] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (social can mean a lot this days ;)
[11-11-2005 16:05:35] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> old school communist I would say poland A
[11-11-2005 16:05:42] [#ezpublish] <_buz> usually it's left wing, but left wing is divided internally
[11-11-2005 16:05:50] [#ezpublish] <_buz> communists are shit heads
[11-11-2005 16:05:59] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> they are post-communits
[11-11-2005 16:06:00] [#ezpublish] <_buz> they idea is nice, but it simply cant work
[11-11-2005 16:06:03] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> we have democracy
[11-11-2005 16:06:28] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> but in goverment is a lof of post-communits
[11-11-2005 16:10:24] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> this was good week, 326 posts on forum
[11-11-2005 16:10:27] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> totaly

[11-11-2005 16:12:50] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> http://www.leiasmetalbikini.com/Profile_VanessaAussie_pic1.jpg

[11-11-2005 16:13:01] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> look at her face :)
[11-11-2005 16:13:04] [#ezpublish] <_buz> weird face
[11-11-2005 16:13:20] [#ezpublish] <_buz> must be very comfortable
[11-11-2005 16:13:21] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> hehe she is scared
[11-11-2005 16:13:23] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> :)
[11-11-2005 16:13:34] [#ezpublish] <_buz> the fat guy is likely near her
[11-11-2005 16:13:46] [#ezpublish] <_buz> jaba the hut or whateve rhis name was
[11-11-2005 16:17:24] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> are going to eZ Conference next year?
[11-11-2005 16:17:39] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's one week before my exam session so i doubt i will
[11-11-2005 16:17:54] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have the same situation
[11-11-2005 16:18:15] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> not sure about exams
[11-11-2005 16:18:30] [#ezpublish] <_buz> and tickets to norway are expensive
[11-11-2005 16:18:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> if i can find the time, i'll likely go
[11-11-2005 16:18:50] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but i'm not too optimistic
[11-11-2005 16:19:07] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> You can flight with KLM to Sandefjord, thats 40 min from SKien
[11-11-2005 16:19:44] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Do trip is nice
[11-11-2005 16:19:45] [#ezpublish] <_buz> last year that was a 300EUR flight
[11-11-2005 16:19:55] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> two way?
[11-11-2005 16:20:06] [#ezpublish] <_buz> yes, but that's quite expensive considering i can get to asia for maybe 600EUR
[11-11-2005 16:20:15] [#ezpublish] <_buz> or to london for <100EUR
[11-11-2005 16:20:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> well booking with 2 months  agou should be cheap
[11-11-2005 16:20:39] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> 2 month before
[11-11-2005 16:20:41] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> for exampe
[11-11-2005 16:21:07] [#ezpublish] <_buz> it's  literally ONE week before my first exam :(((
[11-11-2005 16:21:49] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> thats only 3 days, which you will remeber to the end of your life ;)
[11-11-2005 16:22:01] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> exam you can repeat ;)
[11-11-2005 16:22:05] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> or not?
[11-11-2005 16:22:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> depends
[11-11-2005 16:22:25] [#ezpublish] <_buz> if i pass, i can't but i dont just want to pass, i want a good grade
[11-11-2005 16:22:34] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I usually have 3 chances
[11-11-2005 16:22:54] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> 2 of them are payable
[11-11-2005 16:22:58] [#ezpublish] <_buz> all exam grades are used to calculate my final grade
[11-11-2005 16:23:10] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> this last yhear?
[11-11-2005 16:23:23] [#ezpublish] <_buz> after half, they start using the grades for finals
[11-11-2005 16:23:27] [#ezpublish] <_buz> last two years likely
[11-11-2005 16:23:31] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I see
[11-11-2005 16:23:48] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i need to take a fixed amount of lectures to graduate, how long it takes to do that they dont care
[11-11-2005 16:24:00] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (unless it's like 4times longer than normal)
[11-11-2005 16:24:34] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have to start writing my thesis
[11-11-2005 16:25:15] [#ezpublish] <_buz> illdo that 2007
[11-11-2005 16:25:35] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I have 0,5y on finding materials
[11-11-2005 16:25:53] [#ezpublish] <_buz> 
[11-11-2005 16:25:55] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> then 1y on finishing and finall exame
[11-11-2005 16:26:02] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i have 6 months
[11-11-2005 16:26:16] [#ezpublish] <_buz> before that i can look for a suitable subject however long i want
[11-11-2005 16:27:07] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> I will write about CMS systems in Intranets probadly, or about Open Source Enterprises, not sure exacly depends on materials, have to check that
[11-11-2005 16:27:15] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> have any of you made a contact form with multiple recipients ?
[11-11-2005 16:27:44] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> not possible by default
[11-11-2005 16:28:13] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> you will have to hack ;)
[11-11-2005 16:28:28] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> no i know - i followed some instruction on using the enhancedselection datatype, but i didn't get it to work properly
[11-11-2005 16:28:38] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i guess i could jusr just email filtering
[11-11-2005 16:28:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> really ls[eZ] ?? that sucks :(
[11-11-2005 16:28:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lukas, can I annoy you for a minute with a complex issue ? :)
[11-11-2005 16:28:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> content tree related
[11-11-2005 16:29:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> my diploma paper will likely be some sort of economic analysis
[11-11-2005 16:29:33] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> Katana`: yes
[11-11-2005 16:29:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> or maybe i can coax them into letting me write an open sourcen accounting package
[11-11-2005 16:30:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> okay...
[11-11-2005 16:30:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> on that big project, I have a /products node
[11-11-2005 16:30:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> which holds all the website products, sorted in folders
[11-11-2005 16:31:27] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> yes
[11-11-2005 16:31:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> then they are dispatched around the structure using additionnal locations
[11-11-2005 16:32:08] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> mhm
[11-11-2005 16:32:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> now here comes the issue : these products have subitems
[11-11-2005 16:32:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> these subitems are used to generate contextuel navigation
[11-11-2005 16:32:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i can show you an example...
[11-11-2005 16:32:53] [#ezpublish] <ls[eZ]> would be nice
