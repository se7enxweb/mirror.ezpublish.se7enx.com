[12-22-2005 04:00:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I am asking myself how to implement some kind of "acid" operation using myisam tables .... anyone had the same need? :)
[12-22-2005 04:00:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think they support ACID
[12-22-2005 04:00:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> why cant you use innodb
[12-22-2005 04:00:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm not even sure if innodb truly is acid
[12-22-2005 04:01:53] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> for me, MySQL is simply not a true RDBMS :p
[12-22-2005 04:01:57] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi buz. myisam ain't acid , innodb comes close ...
[12-22-2005 04:02:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> seasonfive: its getting there
[12-22-2005 04:02:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course postgre is still ahead but postgre is a bitch to maintain compared to mysql
[12-22-2005 04:02:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> both are HARMLESS compared to the commercial juggernauts
[12-22-2005 04:02:50] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: like Oracle ?
[12-22-2005 04:02:53] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ... the fact is that I have a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig myisam table which will be updated with a batch from an xml file, and each record could be both insert or update, depending on a field's value ....
[12-22-2005 04:02:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-22-2005 04:03:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> cant you just convert it to inno?
[12-22-2005 04:03:17] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so the problem is, in case of failure, that I cannot just resubmit the old batch as it simply won't work
[12-22-2005 04:03:30] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I don't know. I am having resistance about this.
[12-22-2005 04:03:34] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so ...
[12-22-2005 04:03:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think inno is recommended for ez 3.6+ no?
[12-22-2005 04:03:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I was thinking that maybe I could just emulate this transaction by building a tmeporary memory tabel
[12-22-2005 04:03:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> SEAwolf|py: are you using postgre with ez?
[12-22-2005 04:04:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and if all is ok, then I'll save it into table
[12-22-2005 04:04:02] -!- ez_schroeder [n=kvirc@p50909C44.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit [Client Quit]
[12-22-2005 04:04:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's gonna be efficient for suuuuure
[12-22-2005 04:04:20] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> .... but I wanted to know if anyone had similar needs and found another solution
[12-22-2005 04:04:38] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> heh :) yeah buz ... we play with the deck of cards the client gives :)
[12-22-2005 04:05:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> buz: the db in object is an external db which I hook into ez
[12-22-2005 04:05:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> tell the client what he wants to do isn't safe
[12-22-2005 04:05:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> if he doesnt want to change, go with it and let it burn
[12-22-2005 04:05:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well, this solution surely can help me check if there are any syntax errors
[12-22-2005 04:05:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> get written approval that you should do an ugly hack
[12-22-2005 04:07:06] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> I really like MySQL / PostgreSQL slogan :
[12-22-2005 04:07:30] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> most used open source database / most advanced open source database :)
[12-22-2005 04:08:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I never had the time to actually check/examine pgresql
[12-22-2005 04:08:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> has neat features
[12-22-2005 04:08:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> but setup is quite a bit harder than for mysql
[12-22-2005 04:08:53] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> yes, its why everybody go to MySQL
[12-22-2005 04:09:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> in the past, postgre was slow, too
[12-22-2005 04:09:35] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (and of course for the "fastest" argument of MySQL too)
[12-22-2005 04:09:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> mysql is only fast for many selects, few updates
[12-22-2005 04:09:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hm
[12-22-2005 04:09:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: for me slow wasn't a problem
[12-22-2005 04:10:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> for me neither
[12-22-2005 04:10:10] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz:  you can easily buy bigger computer
[12-22-2005 04:10:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> but the pain of maintaining it
[12-22-2005 04:10:42] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but not have trigger, cascading etc is a problem for me :p
[12-22-2005 04:11:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> i rarely interface with the db myself so its not much of an issue for me
[12-22-2005 04:12:46] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well ... this project requires me to use ezxml and interfacing with this ext db .... each node is about 1 - 1.5 kb .... and we easily get batches of 10.000 and up nodes
[12-22-2005 04:13:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> go for something with proper transactions then
[12-22-2005 04:13:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> everything else is just plain criminal in my view
[12-22-2005 04:13:37] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> *sigh*

[12-22-2005 04:45:10] [#ezpublish] <philG> i want know waht is the best size and specificity for a server with ezpublish
[12-22-2005 04:45:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it really depends on the site complexity and amount of traffic...
[12-22-2005 04:45:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 04:45:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> what do you want to do with it
[12-22-2005 04:46:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> base line is likely 2ghz cpu and 1gb ram
[12-22-2005 04:46:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah maybe 512mb can be enough
[12-22-2005 04:46:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> but more surely wont hurt
[12-22-2005 04:47:32] [#ezpublish] <philG> 350 users Katana`
[12-22-2005 04:47:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> how active
[12-22-2005 04:47:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> and more importantly, doing what?
[12-22-2005 04:48:06] [#ezpublish] <philG> only intranet ...
[12-22-2005 04:48:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> just browsing a mostly static site?
[12-22-2005 04:48:19] [#ezpublish] <philG> more of them just view the site
[12-22-2005 04:48:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> or updating it all the time
[12-22-2005 04:48:28] [#ezpublish] <philG> only a few add content
[12-22-2005 04:48:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> any decent server should do the job then
[12-22-2005 04:48:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 04:48:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> since you'll have viewcaching
[12-22-2005 04:48:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> some P4 2.6+ GHz, at least 1GB of RAM
[12-22-2005 04:48:54] [#ezpublish] <philG> ok Katana`
[12-22-2005 04:49:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> cheap and cheerful: http://www.sun.com/servers/entry/x2100/
[12-22-2005 04:49:34] [#ezpublish] <philG> i can put debian on this serveur buz ? ;-)
[12-22-2005 04:49:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-22-2005 04:49:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's standard opteron
[12-22-2005 04:50:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably need a recent 2.6 kernel for sata but besides that, it will work
[12-22-2005 04:50:31] [#ezpublish] <philG> AMD opteron, i want to check that it's really compatible with linux debian
[12-22-2005 04:50:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the price is unbeaten by even dell
[12-22-2005 04:50:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> it iss
[12-22-2005 04:50:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> indeed, nice stuff
[12-22-2005 04:50:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> and it beats the crap out of xeons
[12-22-2005 04:51:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> i have debian running on a athlon64 (opteron's little desktop brother but same architecture) no issue whatosever
[12-22-2005 04:51:51] [#ezpublish] <philG> ok buz
[12-22-2005 04:52:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> and besides, sun builds good hardware
[12-22-2005 04:52:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> (cant really say that about dell)
[12-22-2005 04:52:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-22-2005 04:52:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> last time i checked, sun was cheaper than the lowend dell even
[12-22-2005 04:53:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> tho i never actually managed to order something at dell at the price they quote on the site
[12-22-2005 04:53:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> i suspect that's impossible
[12-22-2005 04:55:31] [#ezpublish] <philG> the price is just for the rack no buz ?
[12-22-2005 04:55:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> ?
[12-22-2005 04:55:56] [#ezpublish] <philG> 745 $
[12-22-2005 04:55:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think it's server + cpu + 512mb ram
[12-22-2005 04:56:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> as soon as you add more RAM you quickly reach 2000
[12-22-2005 04:56:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 04:56:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> but you can buy your own ram
[12-22-2005 04:56:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> iirc sun doesnt care for that when it fails
[12-22-2005 04:56:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> they just remove it and test their own stuff
[12-22-2005 04:57:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> the things are damn noisy though
[12-22-2005 04:57:16] [#ezpublish] <buz> they definitely arent useable outside a server room
[12-22-2005 04:57:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i won't install one in my bedroom then ;)
[12-22-2005 04:57:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> most ridiculous thing ever are dell poweredge 2850
[12-22-2005 04:57:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> a friend of mine has a cisco router in his living room... 64 ports
[12-22-2005 04:57:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> plug em in and they start making alot of noise
[12-22-2005 04:57:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> he's kind enough to stop it when i come over ;)
[12-22-2005 04:57:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> "oh, it spowered itself on"
[12-22-2005 04:58:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> no it didnt, you need to turn it on after which the thing sounds like a fucking airplane
[12-22-2005 04:58:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> "no no it's just residual noise"
[12-22-2005 04:58:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 04:58:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> but nobody actually knows why a machine is spinning fans when its not even powered on
[12-22-2005 04:58:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> silence costs money ;)
[12-22-2005 04:59:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 04:59:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> i spent nearly as much for silencing components than i did for cpu and motherboard in my last machine
[12-22-2005 04:59:48] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> btw a server is always on ... :p
[12-22-2005 04:59:58] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: same here !
[12-22-2005 05:00:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> seasonfive: not during transport, no ;)
[12-22-2005 05:00:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> i even have a fanless psu
[12-22-2005 05:00:36] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: i could change mother board/CPU but i prefer change box and fans
[12-22-2005 05:00:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> well i needed new components, the old ones died of bad cap syndrome
[12-22-2005 05:01:00] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: i have only 12 & 8 cm fan running quite low
[12-22-2005 05:01:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> my whole box is cooled by a single 120mm fan spinning at 800rpm
[12-22-2005 05:01:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> near silent
[12-22-2005 05:01:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> of course i dont have fancy vga cards or anything like that
[12-22-2005 05:01:43] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> the problem is still my 4 hard-disks ... But i switch off them when not used. When i look film, only one is ON
[12-22-2005 05:02:30] [#ezpublish] <philG> not really clear the site of sun ... buz
[12-22-2005 05:02:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah the raid5 is my main problem
[12-22-2005 05:02:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> cant just turn one disk off
[12-22-2005 05:03:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> what disks have you got? seagate? samsung?
[12-22-2005 05:03:12] [#ezpublish] <philG> it's difficult to understand what composant is install in the 745$ solution ...
[12-22-2005 05:03:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> philG: lemme check
[12-22-2005 05:03:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> philG: you in the us?
[12-22-2005 05:04:04] [#ezpublish] <philG> no in france buz
[12-22-2005 05:04:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh my french is rusty
[12-22-2005 05:04:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the french site is broken
[12-22-2005 05:04:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> but the configshould be the same as in switzerland
[12-22-2005 05:04:57] [#ezpublish] <philG> ok i try in switzerland
[12-22-2005 05:05:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> probably easiest to just call sun
[12-22-2005 05:05:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> usually their support is good
[12-22-2005 05:08:34] [#ezpublish] <philG> switzeland server don't work too .... congratulation sun ...
[12-22-2005 05:08:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh swiss redirects me to resellers that sucks
[12-22-2005 05:10:18] [#ezpublish] <philG> french canadian perhaps
[12-22-2005 05:11:48] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: Seagate, WD and ... don't remember :p
[12-22-2005 05:12:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> i found  wd to be noisy as hell
[12-22-2005 05:12:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> only maxtor was worse
[12-22-2005 05:12:41] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: i have one maxtor too ! :)
[12-22-2005 05:12:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm gonna kick  mine
[12-22-2005 05:12:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> or put it in the basement or something like that
[12-22-2005 05:12:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> buz: moreover my WD sometimes do some "cliik .... claaaakk"
[12-22-2005 05:13:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> next to central heating it can to as much noise as it cares to
[12-22-2005 05:13:26] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> :D
[12-22-2005 05:13:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> but our new main heating unit is one noisy sucker
[12-22-2005 05:13:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> sounds like an overly loud dish washer at times
[12-22-2005 05:13:57] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i thought to externalize one box with these hard-drive in my toilets and do NFS/samba
[12-22-2005 05:14:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> i tried that
[12-22-2005 05:14:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> not a bad way but heat can be a problem in small rooms
[12-22-2005 05:14:28] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> works great ?
[12-22-2005 05:14:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> well its slower than locally
[12-22-2005 05:14:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> but usually you dont notice it much
[12-22-2005 05:15:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> i thought of maybe building a big box for the drives, stick a 80mm fan in it and put a lot of insulation around it
[12-22-2005 05:16:16] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i thinkg with Giga Ethernet you can read 20/30Mb by sec ?
[12-22-2005 05:16:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> s/read/reach
[12-22-2005 05:17:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> the sad part is my 4 hard disk isn't same size, can't do RAID 5 :-/

[12-22-2005 06:05:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> these days for home use i'd go software
[12-22-2005 06:05:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> more flexible
[12-22-2005 06:05:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> and muuuch cheaper
[12-22-2005 06:05:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah gige should be  plenty fast IF you got gige switches ;)
[12-22-2005 06:13:22] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> really, its _REALLY_ fun to build website with ezPublish. Good job guys !
[12-22-2005 06:13:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's why most of us are here you know
[12-22-2005 06:14:22] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> =]
[12-22-2005 06:14:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> becasue it's fun?
[12-22-2005 06:14:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> that and because of the dead raven fetish some of us share
[12-22-2005 06:14:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> if we thought it sucked we'd likely use another cms, no?
[12-22-2005 06:14:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> or becasue of the high amount of both technicality and high-quality noise? ;)
[12-22-2005 06:15:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes that too
[12-22-2005 06:15:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> and no trolls
[12-22-2005 06:15:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> mostly not
[12-22-2005 06:15:32] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ah, am I in the eZ CMS channel??? whoops ... now I understand WHY many of the stuff I read here does not apply to my cms installations
[12-22-2005 06:15:33] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> :))
[12-22-2005 06:15:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> that because you never do standard stuff, Sulfur
[12-22-2005 06:16:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> nobody quite knows what it is you do, anyhow
[12-22-2005 06:16:05] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> point taken
[12-22-2005 06:16:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well ... yes ... I can say that I still have to do a STANDARD ezp project
[12-22-2005 06:16:27] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is there ezpublish contributor here ?
[12-22-2005 06:16:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> contributor as in what
[12-22-2005 06:16:50] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> code, documentation, howto ...
[12-22-2005 06:16:56] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> my first ezp project was actually a GIANT ezp extension ;)
[12-22-2005 06:17:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> well the [ez] guys work for ez ;)
[12-22-2005 06:17:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> and some of the others (such as my self) write extensions
[12-22-2005 06:17:14] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> poke them with a dead raven
[12-22-2005 06:17:42] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is ez recruiting ? :p
[12-22-2005 06:17:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> depends on the country i guess

[12-22-2005 06:27:04] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] Hi all. As you may be aware, about 6 hours ago freenode restarted a number of servers per the news article posted yesterday evening ( http://freenode.net/news.shtml ). In the process of restoring the network, a number of users lost their identifications to NickServ.
[12-22-2005 06:27:37] -lilo:$*- [Global Notice] If you're no longer identified to NickServ, you may want to manually reidentify or restart your client. Thanks, and thank you for using freenode!

[12-22-2005 10:41:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmm .. I need an extension to the xslt-extension. probably someone already made an exslt-extension for it?
[12-22-2005 10:44:23] [#ezpublish] * Katana` doesn't know what he should do when eZ crashes upon object publication...
[12-22-2005 10:44:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> probably i only have to compile php with "--with-dom-exslt"?!?!?
[12-22-2005 10:46:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hmmm .. definetely its not enough, the extension has to be extended.
[12-22-2005 10:47:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> FGH ?
[12-22-2005 10:47:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fh[eZ] even ?

[12-22-2005 11:23:14] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> is it possible to do a transltion extension without ezlupdate ?

[12-22-2005 11:27:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> and swiss banks hire just about anyone with a SMALL clue of finance
[12-22-2005 11:27:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ah, the same here ;) But I more into programming then into finacial stuff.

[12-22-2005 13:00:26] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> actually i´m from franconia, nürnberg.
[12-22-2005 13:00:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> which in turn is (i think, at least) capital of bavaria no?
[12-22-2005 13:00:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yes, true.
[12-22-2005 13:01:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but the franconians rather want to be considered separatly from the rest of bavarians, hehe.
[12-22-2005 13:01:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but this is not valid for me, cause i dont care.
[12-22-2005 13:02:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the bavarians are already freistaat no?
[12-22-2005 13:02:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed, they are.
[12-22-2005 13:03:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> when u enter this federal state, you can recognize the inscription "Freistaat Bayern" at the highway.

[12-22-2005 13:05:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> still want me to pay
[12-22-2005 13:05:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> they can try sueing me here if they care
[12-22-2005 13:06:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> wait, until the swiss is in the EU. :P
[12-22-2005 13:06:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this may last some time.
[12-22-2005 13:06:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> i certainly wont lose sleep over that
[12-22-2005 13:06:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah.
[12-22-2005 13:06:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> besides even in the eu they'd have to sue locally over something like that
[12-22-2005 13:07:07] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> true.
[12-22-2005 13:07:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> besides its like 300EUR or something
[12-22-2005 13:07:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> back from the days when i wasnt even 18
[12-22-2005 13:08:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe, youth sins.
[12-22-2005 13:09:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> btw ... is it true that 'xslt_process' cant process exslt even when php is compiled with exslt?
[12-22-2005 13:09:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont even know what exslt is
[12-22-2005 13:11:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is an extension to the normal xslt-processing, so you can use for instance regular expressions and things like that.
[12-22-2005 13:12:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> that sounds like a bad mixture
[12-22-2005 13:12:16] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this is means i have to alter the xslt-extension for the usage.
[12-22-2005 13:12:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> i used to think xslt is neat. but i was wrong. it's really a rather weird concept.
[12-22-2005 13:13:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hehe ;) its cool in my eyes. multiple formats as export. wonderful.
[12-22-2005 13:13:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-22-2005 13:13:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> but the language itself is just weeeeird
[12-22-2005 13:13:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but to write xslt is a bit tricky.
[12-22-2005 13:13:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> are there any swiss around, btw?
[12-22-2005 13:14:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> and its sloooow
[12-22-2005 13:14:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> its only about matching nodes ;)
[12-22-2005 13:15:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed, its slow. but the results can also be cached.

[12-22-2005 20:34:36] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm
[12-22-2005 20:38:17] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> maybe something like fetch(content,tree,hash(...,class_filter_type,include,class_filter,array('book','magazine')
[12-22-2005 20:38:22] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> donno really
[12-22-2005 20:38:36] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> you have to check it out if you can use filters like that
[12-22-2005 20:39:48] [#ezpublish] <Bedlore> yes if your fetching a tree, list node etc that's fine but I don't think that is possible when using content reverse_related_objects
