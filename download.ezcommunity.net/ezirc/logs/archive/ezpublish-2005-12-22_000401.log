[12-21-2005 02:42:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[12-21-2005 02:42:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> toby as in tobias ?
[12-21-2005 02:44:27] [#ezpublish] <tobyS> Katana`: sure, toby as in tobias :)
[12-21-2005 02:44:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the components one ? :)
[12-21-2005 02:45:51] [#ezpublish] <tobyS> Katana`: exactly

[12-21-2005 02:46:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> how are you doing ?
[12-21-2005 02:49:42] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> very busy i guess ;)
[12-21-2005 02:50:53] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> tobyS: ey #ezpublish.de!
[12-21-2005 02:51:19] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nah stay with us
[12-21-2005 02:51:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> there's no country :)
[12-21-2005 02:51:33] [#ezpublish] * Katana` is gonna register ezpublish.fr
[12-21-2005 02:52:24] [#ezpublish] <tobyS> Katana`: sure, a bit stress, but that's usual before christmas :)
[12-21-2005 02:52:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah :)
[12-21-2005 02:52:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> same here, only 8 days left to work before i'm gone for good
[12-21-2005 02:53:04] [#ezpublish] <tobyS> tobmaster: i have 13 open channel tabs by now, where i idle around the whole day, why should i add another? :)
[12-21-2005 02:53:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the real question is "why shouldn't you"
[12-21-2005 02:53:39] [#ezpublish] <tobyS> Katana`: i'd prefer to close some channel tabs instead of adding new ones ;)
[12-21-2005 02:54:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))

[12-21-2005 03:16:44] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> its cool to see that we are getting quite a few from the crew in here :-)
[12-21-2005 03:17:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> definitely :)
[12-21-2005 03:33:54] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> kris10an: in the phpug in dortmund we now have 3 tobis ;)

[12-21-2005 03:52:54] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi :)
[12-21-2005 03:53:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hi all :)
[12-21-2005 03:53:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hi ;)
[12-21-2005 03:54:25] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i recently tried joomla & typo3. ezPublish is definitly the better CMS :p
[12-21-2005 03:55:18] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ;)
[12-21-2005 03:56:22] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> A lot of people like Typo3, for me this one is horrible. I found no logic into this one
[12-21-2005 03:56:27] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> and it will get sooo much better
[12-21-2005 03:56:31] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> anyone tried it ?
[12-21-2005 03:56:32] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> you're going to love it
[12-21-2005 03:56:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've never managed to understand the admin interface
[12-21-2005 03:56:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> worst piece of shit ever as far as i'm concerned
[12-21-2005 03:58:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Katana`: i tried it for 2 days, i still don't understand how it works :p
[12-21-2005 03:58:54] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> on #typo3 guys said i need lot of times to understand. Then i don't see real advantages of Typo3 against home made PHP cms ...
[12-21-2005 03:59:07] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> btw, i don't want to troll :p
[12-21-2005 03:59:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-21-2005 04:01:05] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> hm.. the same could be said about ez publish ..
[12-21-2005 04:01:14] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> large systems like this take some time to understand properly
[12-21-2005 04:01:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not the admin interface for the end user at least ;)
[12-21-2005 04:02:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but typo3 got no contentObject-model. ;)
[12-21-2005 04:02:14] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Katana`: that is very correct
[12-21-2005 04:02:37] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i still don't understant "Constant" & "Setup" things.
[12-21-2005 04:02:51] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> More over you can override plugins template only at page basis.
[12-21-2005 04:03:09] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> if you need one plugin twice in a page with two different template, you simply can't
[12-21-2005 04:09:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> (booming, enfatic voice) *the best cms, proudly presented by your friendly eZ neighborhood folks!* :P
[12-21-2005 04:11:01] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> is there a way to clear all cache only for the "user" site ?
[12-21-2005 04:11:27] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (i mean with click, without rm -rf things :p)
[12-21-2005 04:12:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not that i know of
[12-21-2005 04:13:23] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> sad ... Could be nice to clear cache for one siteaccess or better, for one page
[12-21-2005 04:14:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> we really need a new server.. avg load 22
[12-21-2005 04:14:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> this is too much :)
[12-21-2005 04:17:42] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> if my coworker wasn't as dumb, i could propose mirror :-/
[12-21-2005 04:18:06] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> seasonfive: and Katana` ...  clearcache.sh should have a siteaccess switch , IIRC
[12-21-2005 04:21:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> seasonfive: we mainly need a new dedicated server...
[12-21-2005 04:21:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> or a more powerful one, but at least something :)
[12-21-2005 04:21:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, THEY need
[12-21-2005 04:21:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> I don't :)
[12-21-2005 04:22:40] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> mirror could be good too, then you can round-robin the DNS :p
[12-21-2005 04:23:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-21-2005 04:26:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> {$article.object.data_map.intro.data_text|shorten(40)}
[12-21-2005 04:26:31] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> this display nothing but when i remove shorten(40) that works. any idea ?
[12-21-2005 04:28:44] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ok i found
[12-21-2005 04:36:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what was it ?
[12-21-2005 04:42:35] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> {$article.object.data_map.intro.data_text} begin with "<?xml ..." stuff
[12-21-2005 04:42:50] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> heh
[12-21-2005 04:42:58] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> and then shorten short these and produce invalid HTML code which hide content
[12-21-2005 04:43:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> you need to strip the tags away beforehand :)
[12-21-2005 04:43:11] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> exactly :)
[12-21-2005 04:44:29] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ... but how ?
[12-21-2005 04:45:16] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> wash(text) is ok ?
[12-21-2005 04:50:27] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> {$object.data_map.intro.content.output.output_text}
[12-21-2005 04:53:33] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> PHPOperatorList[striptags]=strip_tags
[12-21-2005 04:53:37] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> in template ini
[12-21-2005 04:53:44] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> then you can use |striptags
[12-21-2005 04:54:24] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> what is the best way ?
[12-21-2005 04:54:53] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> striptags strip stuff like <b> too i think ?
[12-21-2005 04:55:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> patch owns
[12-21-2005 04:55:47] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> seasonfive: you can not use "shorten" with <b>
[12-21-2005 04:55:59] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> that make sense :)
[12-21-2005 04:55:59] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Katana`: yeah, along the same lines as grep
[12-21-2005 04:56:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep :)
[12-21-2005 04:56:14] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> then you can get something like "Its is <b>cool<"
[12-21-2005 04:56:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm not really experienced with it but i'm learning ;)
[12-21-2005 04:56:25] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> kris10an: you're right, thanks :)
[12-21-2005 04:56:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> first site migrated from 3.6 to 3.7, one more to go
[12-21-2005 04:56:48] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> grep is main reason why I dumped windos 95 for linux
[12-21-2005 04:56:56] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> a long time ago

[12-21-2005 05:03:58] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> kris10an: i didn't suceed to put stritags

[12-21-2005 05:04:42] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but |striptags do nothing

[12-21-2005 06:23:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kris10an, *sigh* | sadly this is true. I did have more help but many have drifted away from anything eZ :\ sucks
[12-21-2005 06:25:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, i'm prolly using and maintaining ezp2 alone :D

[12-21-2005 06:28:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> do we have an alpha date for ezp 4 ?
[12-21-2005 06:28:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> but i faltered and started doing some v3 off and on along the way (don't want to loose touch)
[12-21-2005 06:29:18] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah, i too am wondering when more info on just a tidbit of what v4 might look like :)

[12-21-2005 06:34:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-21-2005 06:34:50] [#ezpublish] <kracker> the world falls away and if your not careful you with it (dear in headlights)
[12-21-2005 06:35:20] [#ezpublish] * Katana` has to pee
[12-21-2005 06:35:39] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> Katana`: be sure to test beta2 so we can make it as good as possible before releasing
[12-21-2005 06:35:45] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> let me help you picture it: ++++++++++[>+++++++>++++++++++>+++>+<<<<-]>++
[12-21-2005 06:36:19] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> something i don't understand
[12-21-2005 06:36:29] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> when i use {node_view_gui view=line content_node=$article}
[12-21-2005 06:36:39] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> template is ctr/override/template/line/article.tpl
[12-21-2005 06:36:41] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> but when i use
[12-21-2005 06:36:45] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> {node_view_gui view=boxed content_node=$article}
[12-21-2005 06:36:58] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ctr/override/template/boxed/article.tpl isn't loaded.
[12-21-2005 06:37:00] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> any idea ?
[12-21-2005 06:37:25] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> seasonfive: you need an overriderule in override.ini to make that happen
[12-21-2005 06:37:49] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> hmmm or perhaps should i put this in ctr/template/boxed/article.tpl ?
[12-21-2005 06:38:29] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> no, don't work more
[12-21-2005 06:38:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> seasonfive: if you use that function it will try to load node/view/boxed.tpl
[12-21-2005 06:39:00] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> if you have an override-rule in override.ini you can specifiy another template
[12-21-2005 06:39:10] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> ok i see. thanks :)
[12-21-2005 06:39:12] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> like you have for article - line
[12-21-2005 06:39:39] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> and remember that the order (position in file) of the overriderules in override does matter
[12-21-2005 06:40:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> you guys [@eZ] wouldn't happen to know of anyone who has chosen to stay with v2 and still has a need for new features would ya :\ (like php4.4/php5 compatablity or ... other)
[12-21-2005 06:42:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> that works, thanks.
[12-21-2005 06:44:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> nods, people who are interested (i have been commiting a lot more this month and a lot more bug fixes are comming to svn) and can keep in touch with the updates via rss      http://svn.web.ezcommunity.net/rss.php?repname=ezcommunity&path=%2F&rev=0&sc=0&isdir=1
[12-21-2005 06:46:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> heh, i'd start a #ezpublish.v2 irc channel but i'd just end up talking to myself (which is different from normal when graham?)
[12-21-2005 06:47:37] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-21-2005 06:47:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> should i create #ezpublish.fr
[12-21-2005 06:47:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ...
[12-21-2005 06:50:52] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> kracker: i don't have the overview over who uses ezp2, so i can unfortunately not tell you anything..
[12-21-2005 06:51:00] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> :-/
[12-21-2005 06:54:09] [#ezpublish] <kracker> yeah, i should ask bertrand (eZ rep) anyway
[12-21-2005 06:55:00] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's gonna be easy at eZ systems, with 2 french Bertrand ;)
[12-21-2005 06:55:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> omfg two of that kind
[12-21-2005 06:56:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yay
[12-21-2005 06:56:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's kinda funny, it's really not a common name in france
[12-21-2005 06:58:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok with 112000 dummy objects, cached pages load in about 0.35s as opposed to 0.2s with nearly empty db
[12-21-2005 07:01:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> that's good isn't it ?
[12-21-2005 07:01:28] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sounds good
[12-21-2005 07:02:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> i wish i had the hardware for a test with 1mio objects on hand
[12-21-2005 07:02:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> takes ages to generate that many content objects, for sure
[12-21-2005 07:02:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i'mgonna revive one of those old machines behind my desk
[12-21-2005 07:04:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what do you guys think of our documentation ? http://doc.waterproof.fr/phpedit
[12-21-2005 07:04:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> whoa
[12-21-2005 07:04:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezcontentobject_attribute  175.434  	  InnoDB   	    208,3 MB   	     -
[12-21-2005 07:04:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ouchie
[12-21-2005 07:05:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> but wtf are aöö ezcontentobject_name, _tree and _version only half as many lines as there are objects???
[12-21-2005 07:08:18] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> {$node.object.data_map.intro.content.output.output_text|striptags|shorten(45)} return nothing but {$node.object.data_map.intro.content.output.output_text|striptags} does. Any idea ?
[12-21-2005 07:09:03] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> (i tried to add |trim between striptags & shorten. no effect)
[12-21-2005 07:10:13] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> oh
[12-21-2005 07:10:14] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i have
[12-21-2005 07:10:16] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> "eZTemplate:Attribute node-object-cached of variable $resourceData was not found but variable node EZ_TEMPLATE_TYPE_OPTIMIZED_NODE is still present. This should not happen"
[12-21-2005 07:12:21] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> what i'm supposed to do now ? :p
[12-21-2005 07:12:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> clear cache ? :)
[12-21-2005 07:12:40] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, i think it's a nice start, though a search form on page (+ drop down for chapters) might be more helpful for finding specific answeres :)
[12-21-2005 07:12:43] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i done that 5 times yet
[12-21-2005 07:12:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah :)
[12-21-2005 07:12:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah kracker, search is planned as well
[12-21-2005 07:13:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what kind of dropdown would you see ?
[12-21-2005 07:13:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> with level 1 navigation ? something else ?
[12-21-2005 07:13:23] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> related pages are implemented as well but there are no relations yet ;)
[12-21-2005 07:13:26] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i kinda recntly found i liked the one on ez.no (main header)
[12-21-2005 07:13:37] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> how to have the cleanest possible cache status ?
[12-21-2005 07:13:41] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> rm -rf var/cache ?
[12-21-2005 07:13:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> rm -rf var/cache/* var/<storagedir>/cache/*
[12-21-2005 07:14:51] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Katana`, i was thinking at the moment of (search relative to current view possition VS searching entire documentation VS searching by documentation chapter ...) the drop down might let them search the whole thing and per chapter / key section / grouping of content
[12-21-2005 07:15:26] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> Katana`: same problem :(
[12-21-2005 07:18:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> oh, search for dropdown
[12-21-2005 07:18:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep, makes sense
[12-21-2005 07:20:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm surprised by the speed of that doc site though
[12-21-2005 07:20:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> static cache?
[12-21-2005 07:20:48] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope...
[12-21-2005 07:20:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> at least it was not configured so i guess it's not there ;)
[12-21-2005 07:21:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol and viewcaching is disabled
[12-21-2005 07:21:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what the hell
[12-21-2005 07:21:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh
[12-21-2005 07:21:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> now it's fast :))

[12-21-2005 07:21:59] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope :)
[12-21-2005 07:22:04] [#ezpublish] <seasonfive> i unchecked "Template Compile" that works now
[12-21-2005 07:29:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh the admin interface cant deal with that many objects
[12-21-2005 07:29:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> keeps crashing
[12-21-2005 07:29:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> apache chews up memory until the the os kills it

[12-21-2005 08:19:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe that's because there are not 3 girls in your office ? :)

[12-21-2005 10:03:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> i get down to about 0.11s on p4 with only 1gb ram

[12-21-2005 10:04:04] [#ezpublish] <kracker> very nice
[12-21-2005 10:04:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> but why doesnt firefox show the rss stream?
[12-21-2005 10:04:22] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i mean last time i looked it was only a (nothing to see here move along page :D)
[12-21-2005 10:04:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> indeed why
[12-21-2005 10:04:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> or more importantly, WHERE does it show rss streams in 1.5? I cant see the icon on slashdot either
[12-21-2005 10:04:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> and it surely displayed it there, before
[12-21-2005 10:05:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh where's your blog, katana

[12-21-2005 10:39:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> indeed, thread-handling is also involved.

[12-21-2005 15:25:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> that would be too good to be true
[12-21-2005 15:25:28] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> hmmm let me think
[12-21-2005 15:25:52] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> ok i think i could take kores php bot and provide an api in ezp shop. then thats no problem
[12-21-2005 15:26:02] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> should be about 1h work :)
[12-21-2005 15:27:05] [#ezpublish] <_buz> but how about the AI that knows WHAt to buy
[12-21-2005 15:27:12] [#ezpublish] <_buz> THAT's the real issue at stake
[12-21-2005 15:28:32] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> not really
[12-21-2005 15:28:43] [#ezpublish] <_buz> in my case it is
[12-21-2005 15:28:52] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> we could provide $channel->shop->list_items();
[12-21-2005 15:28:54] [#ezpublish] <_buz> getting the stuff is much easier than figuring out what to get
[12-21-2005 15:29:17] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> ah sure
[12-21-2005 15:29:29] [#ezpublish] <tobmaster> hmm then we must have a second parameter
