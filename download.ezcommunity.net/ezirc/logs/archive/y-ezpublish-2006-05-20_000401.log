[05-18-2006 13:27:50] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ja det begynner å gå seg til
[05-18-2006 13:27:59] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> men det var mye som var forandret fra 3.7.5
[05-18-2006 13:28:30] [#ezpublish] <xbit> ok, har ikke testet 3.8 enda, men drÃ¸yer det litt da tenker jeg :)
[05-18-2006 13:28:59] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ja du burde teste den først en plass det ikke er så nøye
[05-18-2006 13:29:47] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> men alt blir vel helt nytt i v4 igjen uansett :D
[05-18-2006 13:30:04] [#ezpublish] <xbit> mmh, tror 3.7.5 holder lenge enda

[05-18-2006 14:01:14] [#ezpublish] <ls> from admin interface
[05-18-2006 14:01:20] [#ezpublish] <ls> Setup->Packages
[05-18-2006 14:01:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> well, tried it in 3.8?
[05-18-2006 14:03:10] [#ezpublish] <ls> it should work, you can download packages from ez.no
[05-18-2006 14:03:34] [#ezpublish] <ls> http://ez.no/community/forum/install_configuration/how_do_i_retrieve_all_packages_for_my_3_8_install
[05-18-2006 14:04:03] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> tnx!
[05-18-2006 14:04:18] [#ezpublish] <ls> np ;)
[05-18-2006 14:05:11] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I guess this should be downloaded directly in the admin interface... thats propably the plan
[05-18-2006 14:06:14] [#ezpublish] <ls> I'm not sure if this was implemented in the admin, I guess not
[05-18-2006 14:06:16] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> only the extension packages, not the site packages - those you have to implemente by hand
[05-18-2006 14:07:55] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the packages are here: http://ez.no/download/ez_publish/ez_publish_3_stable_releases/3_8/packages
[05-18-2006 14:07:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok . .you can choose between "local" og "ez_systems" repository so i thought it went to ez.no to fetch dem diretcly
[05-18-2006 14:08:04] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yes, have found them :)
[05-18-2006 14:09:37] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> so you can download and install thru admin interface content objects, but not the site styles i think
[05-18-2006 14:10:14] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> great
[05-18-2006 14:10:30] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the Setup Wizard Sites i guess you use in the iinstall wizard
[05-18-2006 14:10:55] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'm about to create an intranet site at work
[05-18-2006 14:12:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the "intranet" package is really great but I want to make it myself from scratch ... best way to learn :)
[05-18-2006 14:12:33] [#ezpublish] <ls> ez_systems that repository is the directory under your ez publish var dir
[05-18-2006 14:12:42] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> oh
[05-18-2006 14:13:03] [#ezpublish] <ls> when you building package you can set vendor tag in the xml package source, then eZ publish will group packages per vendor
[05-18-2006 14:13:36] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i don't recommend using the plain template now - it renders without anything
[05-18-2006 14:14:19] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> you're better off editing the intranet template
[05-18-2006 14:15:28] [#ezpublish] <ls> nnn0: why, it is buggy or something?
[05-18-2006 14:15:51] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> you mean the intranet template from the wizard, or the "intranet solution" that someone created under the gpl lisence
[05-18-2006 14:16:17] [#ezpublish] <ls> someone, read ls ;)
[05-18-2006 14:16:18] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> license
[05-18-2006 14:16:18] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm donno - but before you got a site with a meny and stuff, but now it's different
[05-18-2006 14:17:03] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> my plan was to make a pagelayout from scratch and all other templates ...
[05-18-2006 14:17:32] [#ezpublish] <ls> pagelayout ok, but why rest
[05-18-2006 14:17:37] [#ezpublish] <ls> most of them you can re-use
[05-18-2006 14:17:42] [#ezpublish] <ls> override templates
[05-18-2006 14:18:32] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> it like if you choose plain in the wizards it installs without any packages what so ever
[05-18-2006 14:19:24] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the packages is ok because I get the classes, but the stylesheets is terrable
[05-18-2006 14:20:06] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I guess I'll use table-less layout so the job is mostly redesigning the css-files
[05-18-2006 14:20:13] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> and overrides
[05-18-2006 14:22:09] [#ezpublish] <ls> professional way it to slice the PSD from designer, setup page layout + new site.css, rest templates needs less or more changes, but it is always faster to re-use then make all from scratch
[05-18-2006 14:22:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yeah, that's what I really ment ..
[05-18-2006 14:22:52] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'm also the designer :)
[05-18-2006 14:23:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> really? do you have online portfolio?
[05-18-2006 14:23:29] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> let's say, i'm a "designer" .. not a good one ..
[05-18-2006 14:23:50] [#ezpublish] <ls> ah, ok, designer because of must ;)
[05-18-2006 14:24:00] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I should have someone do the design but we are a small company and needs to keep costs low
[05-18-2006 14:24:14] [#ezpublish] <ls> I see
[05-18-2006 14:24:23] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> http://www.slettum.com/ my homepage, only a static html file :)
[05-18-2006 14:24:23] [#ezpublish] <ls> are you a partner btw?
[05-18-2006 14:24:48] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> http://www.slettum.com/film my first ezpublish site, pretty bad
[05-18-2006 14:25:27] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> well, talked with Farstad about that ... Just have to make time to learn more about this wonderful system, then we'll become a partner
[05-18-2006 14:25:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'm really a network consultant, mostly microsoft products
[05-18-2006 14:26:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> www.nmsport.no -> made this from the intranet package
[05-18-2006 14:27:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> I can't imagine to work with other software for building sites, it saves a lot of time when you know eZ publish, but it is a quite long way
[05-18-2006 14:27:23] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> long way, no shit :)
[05-18-2006 14:27:48] [#ezpublish] <ls> haha, you will love it
[05-18-2006 14:27:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> nice to see that people find it useful
[05-18-2006 14:28:01] [#ezpublish] <ls> intranet stuff
[05-18-2006 14:28:18] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'm getting a hang of it now I think.. enough to know what to do .. my problem is that I have not enough experience with css
[05-18-2006 14:28:44] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> when I finally make a design with CSS, I test it in IE and it's all broken :)
[05-18-2006 14:28:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the template system is also a bit trickey yet
[05-18-2006 14:29:00] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> Ie sucks :D
[05-18-2006 14:29:01] [#ezpublish] <ls> heh, It well known pain
[05-18-2006 14:29:20] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i usually makes an override just for IE and load it with conditional commants
[05-18-2006 14:29:26] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> let's hope IE7 will make our day easier
[05-18-2006 14:29:27] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> comments
[05-18-2006 14:29:33] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> not likely :)
[05-18-2006 14:29:36] [#ezpublish] <ls> comments are cool for IE
[05-18-2006 14:29:42] [#ezpublish] <ls> makes life easuer
[05-18-2006 14:29:46] [#ezpublish] <ls> easier*
[05-18-2006 14:29:52] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> http://www.quirksmode.org/css/condcom.html
[05-18-2006 14:32:01] [#ezpublish] <ls> these days is easier to learn eZ publish :)
[05-18-2006 14:32:24] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Looking forward to the day when ezpublish have a calendar functionality built-in
[05-18-2006 14:32:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> is it ls? because of the documentation ? the new template language?
[05-18-2006 14:33:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> new doc, new tpl syntax, book
[05-18-2006 14:33:12] [#ezpublish] <ls> more resources
[05-18-2006 14:33:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> hope someone makes more books
[05-18-2006 14:34:00] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I know "Allman" at ez systems is working on one
[05-18-2006 14:34:29] [#ezpublish] <ls> yeah I heard something
[05-18-2006 14:34:37] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I really miss a really good documention over the template system ...
[05-18-2006 14:35:01] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the new documentation website is allright if you know where to look
[05-18-2006 14:35:13] [#ezpublish] <ls> old doc is still useful
[05-18-2006 14:35:30] [#ezpublish] <ls> quite a lot of nice information
[05-18-2006 14:35:36] -!- ordna1 [n=ordnas@p549D5FEC.dip.t-dialin.net] has left #ezpublish []
[05-18-2006 14:35:37] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the "how to build an ez publish site" was the thing I learned most from at ez.no
[05-18-2006 14:35:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> heh, I was learn from it as well
[05-18-2006 14:36:03] [#ezpublish] <ls> the best tutorial for beginners
[05-18-2006 14:36:19] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> hope they make more of things like that
[05-18-2006 14:36:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but if it's too easy to learn, how can they earn money? :)
[05-18-2006 14:37:29] [#ezpublish] <ls> well this works on both sides, easy to learn means more people will use it and need support or other services
[05-18-2006 14:37:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> is single sign on possible using the logged on user in windows xp/2k?
[05-18-2006 14:37:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> agreed
[05-18-2006 14:38:53] [#ezpublish] <ls> not sure if this is possible, perhpas with ActiveDirectory
[05-18-2006 14:39:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> anyway sso in eZ publish is a gateway, all login stuff you need to handle by your script
[05-18-2006 14:40:13] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> AD / ldap I hope works, but I don't know with single-sign-on
[05-18-2006 14:40:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> http://ez.no/community/forum/developer/sso/re_sso
[05-18-2006 14:41:08] [#ezpublish] <ls> you can find some examples in the cookieuser contrib
[05-18-2006 14:41:48] [#ezpublish] <ls> we don't have nothing more then this and info about the feature
[05-18-2006 14:44:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> "we"? you work at ez systems?
[05-18-2006 14:44:42] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes
[05-18-2006 14:45:24] [#ezpublish] <ls> check whois ;)
[05-18-2006 14:45:52] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[05-18-2006 14:46:29] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hehe people aren't used to developers actuallly helping out on irc :D
[05-18-2006 14:47:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have seen it here before :) They must really love their work :)
[05-18-2006 14:48:04] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> nothing is better than that
[05-18-2006 14:48:20] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> true
[05-18-2006 14:48:23] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> do that myself, except I'm not a big microsoft-fan
[05-18-2006 14:48:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> .. and that is what I do best ironically
[05-18-2006 14:49:14] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[05-18-2006 14:49:41] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ls: I was on a 4 day course with Allman .. Really good guy, both socially and technically
[05-18-2006 14:50:20] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes, Allman is good, that's true :)
[05-18-2006 14:50:52] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> so that's what you look like :)
[05-18-2006 14:51:26] [#ezpublish] <ls> hehe :)
[05-18-2006 14:51:48] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> poland? Had a girlfriend from Poland
[05-18-2006 14:52:02] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> never known a girl that horny since :)
[05-18-2006 14:52:11] [#ezpublish] <ls> yes, I work from Poland
[05-18-2006 14:52:36] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> So you work with "the community"
[05-18-2006 14:53:18] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> what will you do to get more contributions from the community? I don't know why there is so little ..
[05-18-2006 14:53:29] [#ezpublish] <ls> Yep, but not only
[05-18-2006 14:53:57] [#ezpublish] <ls> We have more then 300 contributions now, I think it is quite a lot
[05-18-2006 14:54:29] [#ezpublish] <ls> we will have also new Project section which will be much better for developers
[05-18-2006 14:54:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> great .. what about competitoins?
[05-18-2006 14:55:09] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> If I don't remember wrong there was something like that regarding site design
[05-18-2006 14:55:10] [#ezpublish] <ls> well, first we need good tools for developers
[05-18-2006 14:55:43] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but mostly crappy contributions ... The only really great sitedesign able to download is the intranet solution .. but that is my opinion
[05-18-2006 14:56:27] -!- awormus_ [n=aaron@p54B13AC6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has joined #ezpublish
[05-18-2006 14:56:35] [#ezpublish] <ls> yep, there is a few nice sitedesign
[05-18-2006 14:56:49] [#ezpublish] <ls> mostly from design competitions
[05-18-2006 14:57:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> in one way, the first versions of ezp 3 had better templates. Ok it was based on tables but a great deal of sample code to "steel" :)
[05-18-2006 14:58:02] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> now the only difference between styledesigns is colors :)
[05-18-2006 14:58:27] [#ezpublish] <ls> in most of them yes
[05-18-2006 14:58:38] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but the case with packages is of course very flexible
[05-18-2006 14:58:39] [#ezpublish] <ls> but CSS is much more powerful
[05-18-2006 14:59:02] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> sure .. but does anyone at ez systems work on ny sitedesign that will be included in the install wizard?
[05-18-2006 14:59:26] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> that could maybe be more appealing to new users as well
[05-18-2006 14:59:51] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the demo sites at ez.no scare people away . :)
[05-18-2006 14:59:52] [#ezpublish] <ls> yep we have plans for this of course
[05-18-2006 15:00:11] [#ezpublish] <ls> better examples with new designs, for blogs, intranet, corporate, etc
[05-18-2006 15:00:28] [#ezpublish] <ls> bundled with extensions if need
[05-18-2006 15:00:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> have any idea when?
[05-18-2006 15:01:24] [#ezpublish] <ls> I think some of them should be after conference, can't give you sticky dates
[05-18-2006 15:01:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> genious :)
[05-18-2006 15:01:41] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> looking forward to that
[05-18-2006 15:02:05] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I really love ez publish and I am looking forward to be a partner
[05-18-2006 15:02:23] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> But it's not a good idea before I learn the shit :)
[05-18-2006 15:02:32] [#ezpublish] <ls> Do you come from old table base layouts school? ;)
[05-18-2006 15:03:16] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> well, I don't come from anywhere :) I coded turbo pascal 7.0 back in the old days, after that I have not coded much
[05-18-2006 15:03:27] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> more point-and-click on windows servers :)
[05-18-2006 15:04:16] [#ezpublish] <ls> I see :)
[05-18-2006 15:04:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> http://www.slettum.com/ski/index.php/ski another page I made based on the intranet package :)
[05-18-2006 15:04:58] -!- awormus_ [n=aaron@p54B13AC6.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit ["Leaving"]
[05-18-2006 15:05:01] [#ezpublish] <ls> ok, I see that more good looking sitestyles are need for you ;)
[05-18-2006 15:05:56] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but when I get a hang of the template system and learn some more CSS, I can't see that any other system can make so powerfull dynamic webpages so fast as ez publish
[05-18-2006 15:08:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I talked to a plone-developer ... he was so angry at ez systems for blaming that you say you have open source cms with most users
[05-18-2006 15:10:00] [#ezpublish] <ls> not sure what he meant exactyl
[05-18-2006 15:12:15] -!- DiGiTa|_ [n=pet2poul@84.6.72.79] has quit []
[05-18-2006 15:13:01] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> he ment that plone have more users than you
[05-18-2006 15:13:21] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[05-18-2006 15:13:33] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> i'm glad I choosed ezp over plone
[05-18-2006 15:13:49] -!- awormus [n=aaron@p54B112AE.dip0.t-ipconnect.de] has quit [Read error: 110 (Connection timed out)]
[05-18-2006 15:14:04] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> plone is hard if you don't have a plugin that exactly fits your needs or you are a really creat l77t python-coder
[05-18-2006 15:14:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i know several which has gone from plone to ez - for instance www.klassekampen.no (a norwegian leftists newspaper) have tried both plone and zope, but chose ez publish
[05-18-2006 15:14:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> perhaps plone has more users, but it is base on not popular platform
[05-18-2006 15:15:07] [#ezpublish] <ls> escape from Zope/Plone is so difficult
[05-18-2006 15:15:24] [#ezpublish] <ls> also support is not good enought, I was disapointed with Plone developers support
[05-18-2006 15:15:26] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> also, skolelinux want to migrate from plone to ezp
[05-18-2006 15:15:35] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> k
[05-18-2006 15:15:39] [#ezpublish] <ls> I know Alex, spoke with hime last summer
[05-18-2006 15:15:46] [#ezpublish] <ls> they will use eZ publish
[05-18-2006 15:16:02] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Alex?
[05-18-2006 15:16:54] [#ezpublish] <ls> not sure abut last name, he was in charge with Plone and he was testing and learn more about eZ publish
[05-18-2006 15:17:03] [#ezpublish] <ls> from solelinux
[05-18-2006 15:17:07] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ah
[05-18-2006 15:17:30] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I know Frode from skolelinux, and have talked a bit with a few other guys there
[05-18-2006 15:17:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> haven't tried skolelinux since 2003 or something
[05-18-2006 15:20:51] [#ezpublish] <ls> one of the main reason why FSFE.org switch ot eZ publish was performance and weak support from plone developers
[05-18-2006 15:22:20] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> well, the performance in ez publish isn't the best in the world , is it? :)
[05-18-2006 15:22:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> heard you have to to a lot of hacking with barnimagen.no to get a good performance
[05-18-2006 15:23:12] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> good enough for me
[05-18-2006 15:23:42] [#ezpublish] <ls> Performance depends on many things, eZ publish a hugh application, and like other softwares has some requirements
[05-18-2006 15:24:05] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> sure
[05-18-2006 15:25:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> You can get nice performance with eZ publish
[05-18-2006 15:25:44] [#ezpublish] <ls> some counts you can see here
[05-18-2006 15:25:45] [#ezpublish] <ls> http://ez.no/community/forum/install_configuration/ez_publish_performance
[05-18-2006 15:25:46] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> do you stay in this channel a lot?
[05-18-2006 15:26:14] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> you don't use linux? :-|
[05-18-2006 15:26:34] [#ezpublish] <ls> I use, but it was in times when I had Windows platform
[05-18-2006 15:27:07] [#ezpublish] <ls> I stay here quite a lot

[05-18-2006 15:28:36] [#ezpublish] <ls> Linux is my primary of course
[05-18-2006 15:28:55] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> :) I uses mostly linux at home ... just love knoppix
[05-18-2006 15:29:07] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> no, kubuntu I mean

[05-18-2006 15:30:23] [#ezpublish] <ls> suse is my favorite, installed 10.1 2 days ago
[05-18-2006 15:31:20] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> tried to enable 3d hardware acceleration with the bundled video driver and the pc crashed
[05-18-2006 15:31:26] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> (suse 10.1)
[05-18-2006 15:31:43] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> suse looked good, but didn't support my onboard wireless network card
[05-18-2006 15:31:46] [#ezpublish] <ls> I did not fire up as well
[05-18-2006 15:31:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have a Thinkpad T42, worlds greatest laptop
[05-18-2006 15:32:05] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> 1400x1050 screen
[05-18-2006 15:32:06] [#ezpublish] <ls> heh
[05-18-2006 15:32:10] [#ezpublish] <ls> same here but DELL
[05-18-2006 15:32:18] [#ezpublish] <ls> also with 1400x1050
[05-18-2006 15:32:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh
[05-18-2006 15:32:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> no problem running linux with 1400*1050 on my toshiba
[05-18-2006 15:32:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> even xgl works
[05-18-2006 15:33:15] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> xgl is cool, but I don't like gnome
[05-18-2006 15:33:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> runs with kde no problem
[05-18-2006 15:33:21] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> kde is much better for me :)
[05-18-2006 15:33:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> looking forward to kde with hardware acceleration
[05-18-2006 15:33:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> you just dont get kde window borders
[05-18-2006 15:33:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> but that's it
[05-18-2006 15:33:39] [#ezpublish] <ls> yeah, kde makes life easy
[05-18-2006 15:33:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> i cant stand gnome either ;)
[05-18-2006 15:34:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> otoh, xgl is neat but rather useless
[05-18-2006 15:34:09] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> gnome gives me less functions than windows :)
[05-18-2006 15:34:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> gnome is like the bad parts of os
[05-18-2006 15:34:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> x
[05-18-2006 15:34:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> and none of the good parts
[05-18-2006 15:34:29] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> useless for now, I guess they find a nice use of it later
[05-18-2006 15:34:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> well they have nice uses
[05-18-2006 15:34:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> it just isnt really useful ;)
[05-18-2006 15:34:54] [#ezpublish] <ls> :)
[05-18-2006 15:34:57] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> gnome is clean and nice looking .. at least the icons  - but that's about it :)
[05-18-2006 15:35:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> only thing that really sucks on linux is dual head
[05-18-2006 15:35:11] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> why?
[05-18-2006 15:35:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> for my life, i cant get it to work with screens of differing resolutions
[05-18-2006 15:35:52] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> the different between dual head on my windows computer and linux computer is that on the windows machine, the same wallpaper stays on both screens :)
[05-18-2006 15:35:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok
[05-18-2006 15:36:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> it works fine with the same resolution
[05-18-2006 15:36:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> but 1400*1050 sucks on 20"
[05-18-2006 15:36:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> all resolutions not made for that lcd screen sucks :)
[05-18-2006 15:36:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes, exactly
[05-18-2006 15:37:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> the 20" is 1600*1200
[05-18-2006 15:37:07] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> but I have tried 1280x1024 and 1024x768, worked fine
[05-18-2006 15:37:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> what graphics card
[05-18-2006 15:37:26] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> of course it will be an "empty space"
[05-18-2006 15:37:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> ah well yes
[05-18-2006 15:37:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> that sucks
[05-18-2006 15:37:33] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> radeon I belive
[05-18-2006 15:37:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> on win and osx it works without empty crap
[05-18-2006 15:37:56] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> how do they manage that?
[05-18-2006 15:38:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure
[05-18-2006 15:38:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> it cant be too hard
[05-18-2006 15:38:20] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> it have to be a empty space
[05-18-2006 15:38:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> i assume they have virtual screens that are of the same size but only maximize to the actual size of a screen
[05-18-2006 15:38:32] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> below the screen with poorest resolution
[05-18-2006 15:38:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> xgl isnt smart enough for that it seems
[05-18-2006 15:38:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> sorry, xorg
[05-18-2006 15:38:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok, never tried xgl with dual head
[05-18-2006 15:39:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> xgl cant do dualhead for all i know
[05-18-2006 15:39:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok
[05-18-2006 15:39:18] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> kde even have a beagle frontend, that's cool
[05-18-2006 15:39:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> beagle sucks badly
[05-18-2006 15:39:36] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> should support more backend ..
[05-18-2006 15:39:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> i did some tests with it, uses shitloads of cpu and doesnt find anything useful
[05-18-2006 15:39:46] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> suck? why? mono?
[05-18-2006 15:40:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> it searchs through my mail and finds my own emailaddress 10 times
[05-18-2006 15:40:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> whereas i got about 50K mails
[05-18-2006 15:40:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> totally useless
[05-18-2006 15:40:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok, was abit isappointed about the search results myself
[05-18-2006 15:40:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> in other news, we should send some blankets to the devil: http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/05/18/dell_picks_amd/
[05-18-2006 15:40:47] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> remember it's beta :)
[05-18-2006 15:40:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> he must be feeling very cold
[05-18-2006 15:42:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh and my laptop wont hibernate under linux when i use nvidia drivers
[05-18-2006 15:42:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> with opensource drivers it works but those are slow
[05-18-2006 15:43:15] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> hope ati and nvidia will open up the drivers some day
[05-18-2006 15:43:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> not gonna happen
[05-18-2006 15:43:55] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> maybe not as long as it's the gamers that drives the industry forward - and they all use Windows
[05-18-2006 15:44:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Intel cards are pretty well supported from opensource drivers, right? maybe they make some good 3d-cards in the future as well
[05-18-2006 15:44:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think nvidia or ati even could
[05-18-2006 15:44:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> they'd get sued right away
[05-18-2006 15:45:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont care for gaming really
[05-18-2006 15:45:25] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> Yes, they say something like that on the webpages
[05-18-2006 15:45:42] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> puzzle bobble is the only game you need :)
[05-18-2006 15:46:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> not even that
[05-18-2006 15:46:33] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> if you don't like games or xgl, why do you need another driver?
[05-18-2006 15:46:45] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> isn't the bundled driver good enough viewing 2d?
[05-18-2006 15:47:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> oh i do like xgl
[05-18-2006 15:47:45] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok :)
[05-18-2006 15:47:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> i just dont see what its use is
[05-18-2006 15:47:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm a sucker for all sorts of eye candy
[05-18-2006 15:48:11] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok :) I have the most pretty desktop
[05-18-2006 15:48:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh i never see my desktop so theres not even an image there
[05-18-2006 15:48:42] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> http://www.slettum.com/gallery/new_images.php?1=1&imgid=4672
[05-18-2006 15:49:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> so you could use ION then
[05-18-2006 15:50:34] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> fluxbox is a big huge train compared to ion :)
[05-18-2006 15:54:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> no
[05-18-2006 15:54:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> i need kwin ;)
