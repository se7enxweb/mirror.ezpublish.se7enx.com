[12-02-2005 02:55:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fh[eZ], i've read a few components specs yesterday evening, they kick ass :)

[12-02-2005 02:56:08] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> yep.. amos is working hard on that one
[12-02-2005 02:56:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'm looking forward for the form thing :)
[12-02-2005 02:56:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i've always been quite fond of that topic
[12-02-2005 02:57:20] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> hehehe.. best movie title "Killer ravens from outer space"
[12-02-2005 02:57:48] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I wonder how they get here
[12-02-2005 02:57:56] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> do they fly? or do they have a raven spaceship?
[12-02-2005 02:58:08] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> that was fh[eZ]'s titlei'm not gonna take credit for that one...
[12-02-2005 02:58:19] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> much like this: http://community.epiar.net/view/o620ed418ebcae96c7126d734d577342a4.png
[12-02-2005 02:58:57] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> offcourse all the little raven interceptors come from the raven mothership---
[12-02-2005 02:59:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you guys are insane
[12-02-2005 02:59:23] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> raven mad as we like to call it
[12-02-2005 02:59:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-02-2005 03:00:21] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> ok.. that was enough dead ravens for a whole friday...
[12-02-2005 03:00:29] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i do think so too
[12-02-2005 03:00:35] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> no?
[12-02-2005 03:00:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe you can have another one for lunch
[12-02-2005 03:00:44] [#ezpublish] * buz suggest zombie ravens
[12-02-2005 03:00:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> they gotta be dead, after all...
[12-02-2005 03:00:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> if you're serious !
[12-02-2005 03:01:01] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[12-02-2005 03:01:07] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> zombie ravens ! :D
[12-02-2005 03:01:13] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> that would be a movie
[12-02-2005 03:01:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> something like the birds but with lots of splatter
[12-02-2005 03:01:39] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[12-02-2005 03:01:41] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hehe
[12-02-2005 03:01:51] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> so it will be killer zombie ravens from outer space?
[12-02-2005 03:01:53] [#ezpublish] * buz finds it slightly weird to have ezcomponents for 5.1 but no ezpublish to match it
[12-02-2005 03:01:59] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[12-02-2005 03:02:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-02-2005 03:02:05] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> buz: all in due time :)
[12-02-2005 03:02:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's better han having eZ Publish for 5.1 and no components ;)
[12-02-2005 03:02:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> what's the timeframe for a beta of ezpublish 4?
[12-02-2005 03:02:44] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> june/july currently
[12-02-2005 03:02:52] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> but I have a feeling it might be a bit later
[12-02-2005 03:02:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> also, who do i need to bug to really get my parentowner patch into 3.8
[12-02-2005 03:02:57] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> amos
[12-02-2005 03:03:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh people on the list dont seem to respond at all
[12-02-2005 03:04:17] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> amos is ill lately, and we are way to busy getting components done.. sorry about that
[12-02-2005 03:04:37] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> we have been discussing it internally though, so it is not forgotten
[12-02-2005 03:04:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> are there plans for a hackfest before 3.8?
[12-02-2005 03:04:58] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> we'll probably organize one after christmas
[12-02-2005 03:05:07] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> in january sometime
[12-02-2005 03:05:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> can i suggest friday ;)

[12-02-2005 03:26:05] [#ezpublish] <kris10an> that was what i was afraid of...

[12-02-2005 03:46:42] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> I'm listening to garbage
[12-02-2005 03:46:47] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> can't be good for code quality either
[12-02-2005 03:46:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but it's time for more active music
[12-02-2005 03:46:57] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> Soil sounds like a good choice to me
[12-02-2005 03:47:09] [#ezpublish] <fh[eZ]> ooh, massive attack is nice

[12-02-2005 14:54:59] [#ezpublish] <luke`> I know
[12-02-2005 14:57:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> heineken is probably the worst mainstream beer ever
[12-02-2005 14:57:16] [#ezpublish] <luke`> haha
[12-02-2005 14:57:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok guiness is worse

[12-02-2005 14:58:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> i wanna brew my own beer someday
[12-02-2005 14:58:47] [#ezpublish] <luke`> buz: eZ publish base :D

[12-02-2005 14:59:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> i was thinking more along the line of buz special brew
[12-02-2005 15:00:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe combined with caffeine
[12-02-2005 15:00:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> is there something like chilli beer?
[12-02-2005 15:00:54] [#ezpublish] <luke`> chilli beer, I know cheap beer ;)

[12-02-2005 15:01:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe i'm too drunk for your jokes
[12-02-2005 15:02:40] [#ezpublish] <luke`> beer should be not spicy, should be not to sweet and to bitter
[12-02-2005 15:03:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[12-02-2005 15:03:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'm totally against banana beer ;)

[12-02-2005 15:03:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> hops supposedly are good against cancer but i dont like hops very much
[12-02-2005 15:03:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> makes beer bitter quickly
[12-02-2005 15:04:40] [#ezpublish] <luke`> hehe I have beer for 0,8 USD love poland

[12-02-2005 15:05:21] [#ezpublish] <luke`> high end I would say
[12-02-2005 15:05:29] [#ezpublish] <luke`> we have chaper
[12-02-2005 15:06:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually for heineken it would be cheap by swiss standards but heineken is ultra low end
[12-02-2005 15:06:42] [#ezpublish] <luke`> this beers are everywhere like coca-cola
[12-02-2005 15:06:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> otoh you earn much less than we do so it all balances out in the end
[12-02-2005 15:08:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> no french around? wtf is going on over there: http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/05/12/02/2040237.shtml?tid=123&tid=185&tid=219&tid=106
[12-02-2005 15:08:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> have you gone from crazy to entirely fucked up?
[12-02-2005 15:08:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> (otoh, french must be genius, speaking french perfectly and all that ;)
[12-02-2005 15:10:33] [#ezpublish] <luke`> imho, this is provocation :)
[12-02-2005 15:12:20] [#ezpublish] <luke`> there is no FSF in poland
[12-02-2005 15:12:25] [#ezpublish] <luke`> hmm
[12-02-2005 15:12:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> the fsf is a bunch of shitheads
[12-02-2005 15:12:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> if anything, the EFF is important
[12-02-2005 15:12:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> i mean common, anyone who declares stallman to be their leader has to be completely nuts
[12-02-2005 15:14:17] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[12-02-2005 15:14:51] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> if it comes as a surprise that everyone is nuts - you are even more nuts :DDD

[12-02-2005 15:15:09] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[12-02-2005 15:15:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> never claimed to be sane

[12-02-2005 15:15:47] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> they never vote for the right man/woman :)
[12-02-2005 15:16:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, the swiss occasionally (much to my surprise) occasionally DO vote for the right thin
[12-02-2005 15:16:24] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> this is the same problem sokrates pointed out - nothing has happened :D
[12-02-2005 15:16:39] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm - i agree - i forgot the swiss
[12-02-2005 15:16:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D

[12-02-2005 15:20:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> whole of scandinavia is about as socialist as it comes

[12-02-2005 15:25:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> native?
[12-02-2005 15:25:32] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the sami people
[12-02-2005 15:25:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> aaaaaah

[12-02-2005 15:25:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe go to the swedish border the n;)(
[12-02-2005 15:26:00] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[12-02-2005 15:26:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> do you live under the polar circle though?
[12-02-2005 15:26:32] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> over you mean :)
[12-02-2005 15:26:36] [#ezpublish] <luke`> I had insomnia when I have been there
[12-02-2005 15:26:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> nono under
[12-02-2005 15:26:44] [#ezpublish] <luke`> you have to lookng day during summer
[12-02-2005 15:26:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> where the live is HALFWAY sane
[12-02-2005 15:26:49] [#ezpublish] <luke`> long*
[12-02-2005 15:27:04] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i'm north of the polar circle - for about 500 km at east
[12-02-2005 15:27:07] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> least even
[12-02-2005 15:27:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> strictly judging by music, i should go to finnland
[12-02-2005 15:27:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> but finnish is a totally weird language
[12-02-2005 15:27:34] [#ezpublish] <luke`> normegian also
[12-02-2005 15:27:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> less so for all i know
[12-02-2005 15:27:49] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> it's light all day and night at summer - and now - it's almost pitch black all day long
[12-02-2005 15:27:53] [#ezpublish] <luke`> it is impossible to cut the words :D
[12-02-2005 15:28:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> i find the same about slavic languages ;)
[12-02-2005 15:28:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> norwegian is still closer to german than finnish in any case
[12-02-2005 15:28:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> the finnish are special - norwegians and swidish and danish can understand eachother perfectly - but the finnish ! god nows where they come from :D
[12-02-2005 15:28:52] [#ezpublish] <luke`> haha
[12-02-2005 15:29:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, linguistically, they are asians
[12-02-2005 15:29:05] [#ezpublish] <luke`> but they have nokia :D
[12-02-2005 15:29:10] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> but they know their way about a computer
[12-02-2005 15:29:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> cant remember the exact place but the only place with a remotely similar language is somewhere in asia
[12-02-2005 15:29:31] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> most of all - they have Linus :D
[12-02-2005 15:29:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> could even be polynesia now that i think of it
[12-02-2005 15:29:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> personally i prefer matt dillon of dragonflybsd ;)
[12-02-2005 15:30:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> you norwegians have dvd jon
[12-02-2005 15:30:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> hes much more important
[12-02-2005 15:30:19] [#ezpublish] <buz> or had, anyway
[12-02-2005 15:30:29] [#ezpublish] <luke`> haha, talented crackers and hackers
[12-02-2005 15:30:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> and the swedes have piratebyran

[12-02-2005 15:30:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> swiss have had torrentreactor
[12-02-2005 15:30:56] [#ezpublish] <luke`> buz, you comes from hacker underground
[12-02-2005 15:30:56] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> dvd jon - he just made the interface - donno why the went after him :)
[12-02-2005 15:31:07] [#ezpublish] <luke`> you kna all  scandinavian hackers
[12-02-2005 15:31:13] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[12-02-2005 15:31:14] [#ezpublish] <luke`> know*
[12-02-2005 15:31:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think dvd jon is a front to a bigger group
[12-02-2005 15:31:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> NFW he came up with that all by him self
[12-02-2005 15:31:26] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> it's not a big group
[12-02-2005 15:31:37] [#ezpublish] <luke`> only dvd jon :D
[12-02-2005 15:31:41] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> but the _real_ hacker are from russia :D
[12-02-2005 15:31:41] [#ezpublish] <luke`> haha
[12-02-2005 15:31:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> maybe maybe not
[12-02-2005 15:31:52] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> goddamn they are good ;)
[12-02-2005 15:31:54] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont believe he cracks everything by himself anyway
[12-02-2005 15:32:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> he does has the advantage of living in a free country which makes him an ideal front
[12-02-2005 15:32:26] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> he does bits and pieces
[12-02-2005 15:32:36] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> just check his site
[12-02-2005 16:11:46] -!- buz [n=buz@80-218-105-74.dclient.hispeed.ch] has quit ["Konversation terminated!"]
