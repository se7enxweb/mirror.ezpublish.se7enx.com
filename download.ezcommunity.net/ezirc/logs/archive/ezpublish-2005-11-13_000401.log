[11-12-2005 05:59:41] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> not to mention the kids
[11-12-2005 06:00:07] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hot dame, life's a game, we all the same, fools seeking fame, mispronouce ya name, ;P
[11-12-2005 06:00:14] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-12-2005 06:00:16] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> heh
[11-12-2005 06:00:40] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> we have a long way to go
[11-12-2005 06:01:12] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> everybody have to love each other
[11-12-2005 06:01:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i'm stoked, it's saturday, i finaly got my 8 hdd firewire bay working properly as one connected unit, it's the weekend, another 4,000 in the mail for consulting, another 10k in the bank ... livin the eZ way really does pay
[11-12-2005 06:01:28] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i guess that could happen in lets say 4-500 years from now :D
[11-12-2005 06:01:45] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :D
[11-12-2005 06:01:48] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ez rule
[11-12-2005 06:01:49] [#ezpublish] <kracker> we have to fall again hard before we give up this maddness
[11-12-2005 06:02:02] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i guess
[11-12-2005 06:02:31] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> but the problem is...
[11-12-2005 06:02:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> people like getting screwed :D
[11-12-2005 06:02:48] [#ezpublish] <kracker> and ... i should be finishing my ezgpg + ezorderpayment classes and doing testing but it's like i can't sleep and i'm just ... stalling for sunday to finish it off proper

[11-12-2005 06:03:03] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-12-2005 06:03:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> ehh, people who have never truly lived or have forsaken living for that living dead lifestyle
[11-12-2005 06:04:17] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)
[11-12-2005 06:04:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they have been given an out, our own matrix only worse (i say), many take it, others fight
[11-12-2005 06:04:32] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> :)

[11-12-2005 06:05:15] [#ezpublish] <kracker> me, i'm just waiting to kick it up another epoch notch, out o sight w/ a little dynomight
[11-12-2005 06:05:37] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> live is to short to do anything about it anyway :DD hehe
[11-12-2005 06:05:51] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> that's way nothing changes
[11-12-2005 06:06:06] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> why i mean
[11-12-2005 06:06:10] [#ezpublish] <kracker> they'll get theirs soon enough .. ehh prolly more like over time it will filter down who can say with certanty what will become of all this insanity
[11-12-2005 06:06:16] [#ezpublish] <kracker> sadly
[11-12-2005 06:06:25] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> true
[11-12-2005 06:07:38] [#ezpublish] <kracker> i just finished listening to a really neat, audio book about computer encryption, security, the nsa and some freedom fighters (not bad the second time around either)
[11-12-2005 06:07:45] [#ezpublish] <kracker> Dan Brown - Digital Fortress 01 of 12
[11-12-2005 06:07:56] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> yeah - i read that :D
[11-12-2005 06:07:59] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> ehehehe
[11-12-2005 06:08:24] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> heh i read it straight thru
[11-12-2005 06:08:27] [#ezpublish] <kracker> kinda cool in the begining how they talk about the nsa getting theres but the ending kinda switches gears
[11-12-2005 06:08:42] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> heh
[11-12-2005 06:08:50] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> yeah
[11-12-2005 06:09:09] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> i liked
[11-12-2005 06:09:13] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> that story

[11-12-2005 06:41:29] [#ezpublish] * buz has been wondering about that calendar
[11-12-2005 06:41:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> ez would make a nice base for a complete online office if that thing was working
[11-12-2005 06:50:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> say katana, when will we get a qooxdoo based ez admin interface?
[11-12-2005 06:50:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lol
[11-12-2005 06:50:45] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> when people work on one ? :)
[11-12-2005 06:50:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> how about you ;)
[11-12-2005 06:51:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i could:)à
[11-12-2005 06:51:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but it's not a 1 person job ...
[11-12-2005 06:51:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> not really no
[11-12-2005 06:52:41] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but even a proof of concept would be interesting
[11-12-2005 06:52:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> proving what
[11-12-2005 06:53:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> like browsing content, loading admin content view / edit, etc
[11-12-2005 06:53:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but with actual edition
[11-12-2005 06:54:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> with all the ajax ;)
[11-12-2005 06:54:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok for beginners one could take the tree widget and use ajax for the edit interface
[11-12-2005 06:54:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep
[11-12-2005 06:54:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> the tree widget doesnt seem to support context menu though?
[11-12-2005 06:55:04] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> humm i don't know if it's that it's not supported or just that the demo doesn't mix both
[11-12-2005 06:55:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> what you in effect need: a new content view, that fetched only the middle page
[11-12-2005 06:55:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well, that's what the node view in admin does already
[11-12-2005 06:55:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the rest is pagelayout
[11-12-2005 06:55:45] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[11-12-2005 06:55:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the pagelayout here would contain the JS for the menu and the interface
[11-12-2005 06:56:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes but upon ajax loads you dont want the pagelayout being sent
[11-12-2005 06:56:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's not really hard
[11-12-2005 06:56:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> of course
[11-12-2005 06:56:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> but a lot of work
[11-12-2005 06:56:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah...
[11-12-2005 06:57:10] [#ezpublish] <buz> and frankly, i'd rather see ezxml fixed first
[11-12-2005 06:57:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> imho the most complex part in the beggining is to decide what is done how...
[11-12-2005 06:57:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> lots of analysis first
[11-12-2005 06:57:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> (and telling people to buy the OE is NOT a fix)
[11-12-2005 06:57:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[11-12-2005 06:57:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> xinha beats the shit out of oe
[11-12-2005 06:58:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i don't think they've ever pretended OE was an amazing WYSIWYG editor
[11-12-2005 06:58:24] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's just that it's closer to eZ than xhina ;)
[11-12-2005 06:59:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, the interface part of xinha doesnt need many changes to get it to work with ez
[11-12-2005 06:59:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> but ezxml would
[11-12-2005 06:59:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep...
[11-12-2005 06:59:30] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> OE 4 is supposed to be better but it's not really yet...
[11-12-2005 06:59:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> if someone makes ezxml eat a sane subset of xhtml (current set is far from sane) that would be ok
[11-12-2005 07:00:56] [#ezpublish] <buz> so, new kernel, gotta reboot

[11-12-2005 07:27:39] [#ezpublish] <kracker> see now i've been thinking about, eZ publish rss, content structures (folders, articles, etc) and how it would be nice to simply install an extention or extentions to turn on rss output for an entire site in one motion
[11-12-2005 07:28:36] [#ezpublish] <kracker> or how nice it would be to extend that to have content represented as opml / rss interphase for an entire site out of the box
[11-12-2005 07:28:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> ?
[11-12-2005 07:29:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> you want to do what?
[11-12-2005 07:29:12] [#ezpublish] <nnn0> hm i guess you get this question from time to time, but do any of you have any pointers regarding sorting av array in the template. so the user kan spesify the sorting order in the page ?
[11-12-2005 07:29:19] [#ezpublish] <kracker> have opml support in eZ
