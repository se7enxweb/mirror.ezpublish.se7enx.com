[04-14-2006 03:51:03] [#ezpublish] <niooi> hello
[04-14-2006 03:51:50] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Ez Publish is terribly slow. I have read as much doc obout optimizing it and about turning on all the caches but it remains too slow on our dedicated server!
[04-14-2006 03:52:06] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I have set the memory of php to 128 MB
[04-14-2006 03:52:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> do you use some php accelerator
[04-14-2006 03:59:20] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 03:59:27] [#ezpublish] <niooi> ez accelerator
[04-14-2006 03:59:37] [#ezpublish] <niooi> We have installed Zend Platform
[04-14-2006 04:00:04] [#ezpublish] <niooi> but Zend Platform caches everythin so I turned off the caching engine but we have the PHP Acceleration from Zend
[04-14-2006 04:02:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh i think you should have the cache active
[04-14-2006 04:02:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i have never actually used zend
[04-14-2006 04:05:15] -!- _Katana` [n=Katana@gai69-1-87-91-102-67.dsl.club-internet.fr] has joined #ezpublish
[04-14-2006 04:05:48] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Zend Paltform's cache is on top of eZ Publish caching
[04-14-2006 04:05:56] [#ezpublish] <niooi> it's theredfore not compulsory
[04-14-2006 04:06:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> you should use the same
[04-14-2006 04:06:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's something completely different really
[04-14-2006 04:06:51] [#ezpublish] <buz> _Katana`: anything we can do about http://ez.no/community/bugs/wrong_conversion_of_characters_on_ezxml
[04-14-2006 04:06:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> read the comments
[04-14-2006 04:06:58] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I know it's different. We're using Ez Publish with its caching turned on. It's very slow.
[04-14-2006 04:07:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> so turn on zend cache as well
[04-14-2006 04:07:27] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Let's put Zend platform aside it should not required Zend platform anyway.
[04-14-2006 04:07:35] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's not
[04-14-2006 04:07:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> eaccelerator helps a lot
[04-14-2006 04:07:56] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> yeah, suchis for lunch :)
[04-14-2006 04:08:13] [#ezpublish] <niooi> We should have a decent speed without Zend Platform turned on and I would like to have some hints (knowing all cache is on)
[04-14-2006 04:08:16] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> niooi: eZ publish with cache properly used IS fast
[04-14-2006 04:08:25] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[04-14-2006 04:08:25] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> like < 0.1s for a standard page
[04-14-2006 04:08:35] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Good, so how to cache properly? ;)
[04-14-2006 04:08:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> that is an art
[04-14-2006 04:08:44] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> you new view caching and cache blocks
[04-14-2006 04:08:46] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I guess we do something wrong for sure
[04-14-2006 04:08:50] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> buz can assist you i'm sure :)
[04-14-2006 04:09:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah my job usually involves DEACTIVATING the cache ;)
[04-14-2006 04:09:14] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> tsss
[04-14-2006 04:09:25] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> you are right, it is an art, but once you're used to it it's easy
[04-14-2006 04:09:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> right now it's convincing kirill that the ezxml parser is totally broken
[04-14-2006 04:09:36] [#ezpublish] <niooi> we do not used cache blocks
[04-14-2006 04:09:41] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> you should
[04-14-2006 04:09:42] [#ezpublish] <niooi> or very little
[04-14-2006 04:09:53] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> viewcaching only caches the content part, e.g. module_result.content
[04-14-2006 04:10:00] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I thougt the caching system was working on the page overall
[04-14-2006 04:10:03] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> cache-block has to be used for navigation menus and stuff
[04-14-2006 04:10:05] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> no it's not :)
[04-14-2006 04:10:24] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> an optimized page should run 1 or 2 sql queries (2 if you are fetching the current user)
[04-14-2006 04:10:28] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> no more
[04-14-2006 04:10:31] [#ezpublish] <niooi> hmmmmm sound like there is room for improvement ;)
[04-14-2006 04:10:35] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> yep :)
[04-14-2006 04:10:59] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> http://ez.no/products/ez_publish/documentation/development/kernel/cache_block_optimization
[04-14-2006 04:11:01] [#ezpublish] <niooi> What's viewcaching
[04-14-2006 04:11:04] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> this one you should read
[04-14-2006 04:11:09] [#ezpublish] <niooi> ok I will
[04-14-2006 04:11:14] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> site.ini.append, ViewCaching=enabled

[04-14-2006 04:11:27] [#ezpublish] <niooi> okay let me check this but it must be on for sure
[04-14-2006 04:11:58] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> is TemplateCompile enabled ? is TemplateCache enabled ? is OverrideCache enabled ?
[04-14-2006 04:12:04] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> is PolicyCache enabled ?
[04-14-2006 04:12:14] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> is apache allowed to write to var/ ?
[04-14-2006 04:12:19] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> do you have errors in var/log/error.log ?
[04-14-2006 04:12:56] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 04:13:07] [#ezpublish] <_Katana`> caching is not something you just turn on when the project is done developing. It's 100% part of the developement process, even if it's usually fixed when the project is finished :(
[04-14-2006 04:13:08] [#ezpublish] <niooi> let me check

[04-14-2006 04:14:08] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> cache blocks really helps in speeding a ez site
[04-14-2006 04:15:07] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I'm checking what you 've told me...
[04-14-2006 04:20:26] [#ezpublish] <katana`> there is a learning process in site optimization... once you're used to it a little you'll understand why some parts (ViewCaching for instance) are easier than others...
[04-14-2006 04:20:37] [#ezpublish] <katana`> if caching is part of the developement process, it's much easier
[04-14-2006 04:20:53] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I gues we have a STEEP learning curve because so fast the performance is very poor
[04-14-2006 04:21:04] [#ezpublish] <niooi> fast=far
[04-14-2006 04:21:17] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I cannot find OverrideCache

[04-14-2006 04:24:54] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Thanks katana`. By the way I think I remember your nickname from a php group long time ago or a ftp... group ;)
[04-14-2006 04:26:03] [#ezpublish] <niooi> phpfrance maybe
[04-14-2006 04:26:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> a ftp group ? that's possible, but it would have been like 7 or 8 years ago :)
[04-14-2006 04:26:41] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 04:26:43] [#ezpublish] <niooi> !!!!

[04-14-2006 04:29:09] [#ezpublish] <niooi> me too

[04-14-2006 04:29:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> nostalgy moment..
[04-14-2006 04:29:29] [#ezpublish] <niooi> indeed
[04-14-2006 04:29:46] [#ezpublish] <katana`> I was a student :)
[04-14-2006 04:29:52] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and I had lots of free time
[04-14-2006 04:29:58] [#ezpublish] <niooi> same here
[04-14-2006 04:30:10] [#ezpublish] <katana`> i don't regret any of it anyway... the general knowledge of internet i have now owes a lot to all of that
[04-14-2006 04:30:20] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 04:30:20] [#ezpublish] <zrg> year?
[04-14-2006 04:30:49] [#ezpublish] <niooi> 1995 to 2000
[04-14-2006 04:30:54] [#ezpublish] <katana`> about the same here
[04-14-2006 04:31:00] [#ezpublish] <katana`> 1999, 2001 maybe
[04-14-2006 04:31:00] [#ezpublish] <niooi> but before it was under amiga
[04-14-2006 04:31:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> the MUD years :)
[04-14-2006 04:31:06] [#ezpublish] <katana`> lol
[04-14-2006 04:31:18] [#ezpublish] <katana`> now i just use P2P, it's not that bad in the end ;)
[04-14-2006 04:31:19] [#ezpublish] <zrg> or epoch, id say
[04-14-2006 04:31:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> roommate got serious problems from mud
[04-14-2006 04:31:55] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes P2P is much better
[04-14-2006 04:32:04] [#ezpublish] <niooi> what MUD?
[04-14-2006 04:32:23] [#ezpublish] <zrg> liebe gott!
[04-14-2006 04:32:48] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ah, you mean which?
[04-14-2006 04:33:56] [#ezpublish] <niooi> MUD: what does it stand for?
[04-14-2006 04:34:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> colossal waste of time
[04-14-2006 04:34:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> Multi User Dungeon ? iirc
[04-14-2006 04:35:18] [#ezpublish] <niooi> so to go back to my troubles. If viewcaching is enabled and eveythinf is enabled and it is still slow it is because our developpers should add cache-blocks within the templates
[04-14-2006 04:35:22] [#ezpublish] <katana`> :))
[04-14-2006 04:35:36] [#ezpublish] <katana`> as long as permissions on var/cache and var/cache/site are okay yes
[04-14-2006 04:35:38] [#ezpublish] <niooi> MUD, never used that!
[04-14-2006 04:35:45] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes there are okay
[04-14-2006 04:35:50] [#ezpublish] <niooi> because not empty
[04-14-2006 04:35:51] [#ezpublish] <katana`> but you should check the profiling infos at the bottom of debugoutput to see what slows down your website
[04-14-2006 04:36:00] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Template
[04-14-2006 04:36:06] [#ezpublish] <niooi> is what slows down the page
[04-14-2006 04:36:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> do you have template compile etc on?
[04-14-2006 04:36:18] [#ezpublish] <katana`> do rm -rf var/cache/* var/yoursite/cache/*, reload, and see if the folders are filled correctly
[04-14-2006 04:36:18] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 04:36:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> how long does it take to generate  a page?
[04-14-2006 04:37:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> (not the first time after cache clear ;)
[04-14-2006 04:37:09] [#ezpublish] <niooi> to generate if I erase the cache it can take 10s!!
[04-14-2006 04:37:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> that's normal
[04-14-2006 04:37:29] [#ezpublish] <niooi> oh then it takes between 1 to 3 seconds and much more in the backend
[04-14-2006 04:37:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> then something is seriously wrong
[04-14-2006 04:37:40] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yes, that's normal, you never clear all cache :=)
[04-14-2006 04:37:42] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes for sure
[04-14-2006 04:37:43] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yep... totally
[04-14-2006 04:38:00] [#ezpublish] <buz> what machine does it run on?
[04-14-2006 04:38:06] [#ezpublish] <katana`> err no, 1 to 3 is okay if caching is not properly configured
[04-14-2006 04:38:12] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you can enable viewcaching on the backend as well
[04-14-2006 04:39:17] [#ezpublish] <niooi> on a dedicated servr
[04-14-2006 04:39:26] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Celeron 2 GHz
[04-14-2006 04:39:29] [#ezpublish] <katana`> ouch
[04-14-2006 04:39:31] [#ezpublish] <niooi> 512 of RAM
[04-14-2006 04:39:34] [#ezpublish] <katana`> hard drives ?
[04-14-2006 04:39:35] [#ezpublish] <katana`> whoa...
[04-14-2006 04:39:40] [#ezpublish] <niooi> 160 Go Sata
[04-14-2006 04:39:58] [#ezpublish] <katana`> celeron / 512 is not good, honestly
[04-14-2006 04:40:06] [#ezpublish] <niooi> the memory used is around 300 MB
[04-14-2006 04:40:07] [#ezpublish] <katana`> but you can get much better performances than that anyway...
[04-14-2006 04:40:14] [#ezpublish] <katana`> analyze the profiling infos on Debug Output
[04-14-2006 04:40:25] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it should give you infos about where the bottlenecks are
[04-14-2006 04:40:31] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes that's my point: I know the server is not the best one ut I know it should be so slow
[04-14-2006 04:40:37] [#ezpublish] <niooi> ok
[04-14-2006 04:41:03] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it won't be blazing fast but it should be much faster
[04-14-2006 04:41:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> you should see page load times of about 0.2s
[04-14-2006 04:41:08] [#ezpublish] <katana`> caching is not an option ;)
[04-14-2006 04:41:14] [#ezpublish] <katana`> i'd say 0.4 on that setup...
[04-14-2006 04:41:20] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you need very fast HDs to get blazing fast pages
[04-14-2006 04:41:30] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually, it's more cpu bound i think
[04-14-2006 04:41:35] [#ezpublish] <katana`> both
[04-14-2006 04:41:39] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and 512 of RAM... damn :)
[04-14-2006 04:41:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> for any decent system, everything will be cached in ram anyway
[04-14-2006 04:41:47] [#ezpublish] <katana`> that's the main bottleneck imho
[04-14-2006 04:42:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> to be fair
[04-14-2006 04:42:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> i currently have a 3.7 site on a virtual server, that still gets me sub 0.5s times
[04-14-2006 04:43:03] [#ezpublish] <katana`> cached as hell or not ?
[04-14-2006 04:43:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> all caches on
[04-14-2006 04:43:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> but no specific tuning other than that
[04-14-2006 04:43:23] [#ezpublish] <buz> ok to be fair
[04-14-2006 04:43:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> the machine has light load
[04-14-2006 04:43:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> so in essence one could claim it's mostly dedicated ;)
[04-14-2006 04:43:43] [#ezpublish] <katana`> all caches on is fairly minimal...
[04-14-2006 04:43:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> but no php cache or anything like that
[04-14-2006 04:43:57] [#ezpublish] <katana`> cache-blocks are as important as developing templates
[04-14-2006 04:44:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> i can live with 0,5s for that site ;)
[04-14-2006 04:44:32] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> Don't you think the cause could be some problems in the code ?
[04-14-2006 04:44:39] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> too ?
[04-14-2006 04:44:42] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yeah, i understand :)
[04-14-2006 04:44:45] [#ezpublish] <katana`> possibly
[04-14-2006 04:44:55] [#ezpublish] <katana`> ANY error outputed by debug output should be fixed
[04-14-2006 04:45:10] [#ezpublish] <niooi> ok
[04-14-2006 04:45:16] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I am not a developer
[04-14-2006 04:45:30] [#ezpublish] <niooi> I sawx there are notices but no errors
[04-14-2006 04:45:47] [#ezpublish] <katana`> notices are not good either, but it depends on them
[04-14-2006 04:45:55] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you do have developers do you ? :)
[04-14-2006 04:46:01] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes I do
[04-14-2006 04:46:27] [#ezpublish] <katana`> notices are here for a reason, usually
[04-14-2006 04:46:36] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and they should really look into cache blocks... :)
[04-14-2006 04:47:25] [#ezpublish] <niooi> SO I should told my developers to add cache-blocks on all the templates because without it the caching is not working? rihgt?
[04-14-2006 04:47:38] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> not on all templates
[04-14-2006 04:48:14] [#ezpublish] <katana`> no, to learn how cache blocks work
[04-14-2006 04:48:21] [#ezpublish] <katana`> the article i've sent to you is very good
[04-14-2006 04:48:24] [#ezpublish] <katana`> they should start with that
[04-14-2006 04:48:31] [#ezpublish] <niooi> *I'm reading it
[04-14-2006 04:48:31] [#ezpublish] <katana`> they have to be used PROPERLY ;)
[04-14-2006 04:48:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> one of the issues is that they aren't totally right in the default pagelayout either
[04-14-2006 04:48:56] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> katana: cache block should be used for parts that not depends on $module_result right ?
[04-14-2006 04:49:25] [#ezpublish] <katana`> yep
[04-14-2006 04:49:28] [#ezpublish] <katana`> in most situations

[04-14-2006 04:55:43] [#ezpublish] <katana`> seriously, the hard drive is okay, but a celeron is definitely not a decent production CPU for a webserver :(
[04-14-2006 04:55:55] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you can't have too high expectations with such hardware...
[04-14-2006 04:56:05] [#ezpublish] <katana`> and 512 MB of RAM is really, really not enough :(

[04-14-2006 05:02:11] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> okay debugging is on

[04-14-2006 05:02:34] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> want to have lunch and we'll chat about it afterward
[04-14-2006 05:03:21] [#ezpublish] <katana`> 147 SQL queries... clear sign that this is too much :(
[04-14-2006 05:03:33] [#ezpublish] <katana`> 2.8 secs of template processing, related to the SQL queries count
[04-14-2006 05:03:44] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> why do we have that? (MySQL is replicated on a 2nd server)
[04-14-2006 05:04:09] [#ezpublish] <katana`> well, even if it is replicated, queries are still executed ;)
[04-14-2006 05:04:15] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> sure
[04-14-2006 05:04:23] [#ezpublish] <katana`> because you have lots of fetches and usage of content from the templates, and these are not cached
[04-14-2006 05:04:26] [#ezpublish] <katana`> cache-blocks will fix that
[04-14-2006 05:04:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> i would say mysql and template are at fault ;)
[04-14-2006 05:05:02] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> where do you see the number of queries?
[04-14-2006 05:05:03] [#ezpublish] <katana`> you should end up with 2 queries per page once caching is properly implemented. The output from these blocks will be cached, and the templates won't have to be processed
[04-14-2006 05:05:04] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> duh!
[04-14-2006 05:05:08] [#ezpublish] <katana`> at the bottom

[04-14-2006 05:05:56] [#ezpublish] <katana`> it's not much in itself, but the data from these queries is being processed, and this is visible in the templates part

[04-14-2006 05:06:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> just for reference: on a virtual server, without eaccelerator: http://www.jfdph.ch/index.php
[04-14-2006 05:06:41] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> yes that's the bottleneck
[04-14-2006 05:06:47] [#ezpublish] <buz> no custom cache blocks
[04-14-2006 05:06:52] [#ezpublish] <katana`> so you JUST need cache blocks, that's it
[04-14-2006 05:07:00] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> good
[04-14-2006 05:07:04] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> thanks for your help
[04-14-2006 05:07:11] [#ezpublish] <katana`> buz, it depends a lot on what is implemented outside of content/view
[04-14-2006 05:07:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> 0.4s
[04-14-2006 05:07:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> not much
[04-14-2006 05:07:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> very much default
[04-14-2006 05:07:24] [#ezpublish] <katana`> not much is done outside of it as far as i can see :)
[04-14-2006 05:07:45] [#ezpublish] <katana`> there is a lot of contextual items on niooi's website, e.g. outside of content/view
[04-14-2006 05:07:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> yes
[04-14-2006 05:07:57] [#ezpublish] <katana`> that's where the problem lies
[04-14-2006 05:08:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> only contextual thing i have is http://triligon.org/triligon/blog/two_toolbox_patches_to_sdk_public_sort_order_for_node_list_and_editor_s_little_helper

[04-14-2006 05:09:01] [#ezpublish] <katana`> indeed
[04-14-2006 05:09:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> i cant understand why that doesnt ship with ez
[04-14-2006 05:10:31] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it would make it usable out of box
[04-14-2006 05:12:02] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> Thanks
[04-14-2006 05:12:30] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> I told my dev that we should not have more than 2 MySQL queries if the page is cached properly
[04-14-2006 05:12:47] [#ezpublish] <katana`> good
[04-14-2006 05:12:50] [#ezpublish] <niooi_2> down from 147 to 2 should make an improvement
[04-14-2006 05:13:05] [#ezpublish] <katana`> a tad ;)
[04-14-2006 05:13:06] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mysql4 query cache helps too

[04-14-2006 07:21:42] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: and this ususally happends when one uses to hardcode something - I think this is not my case
[04-14-2006 07:21:49] [#ezpublish] <niooi> Why do you think we still have so many queries knowing that there are cache-blocks in our templates?
[04-14-2006 07:23:02] [#ezpublish] <katana`> the cache blocks are probably not in use
[04-14-2006 07:25:14] [#ezpublish] <niooi> what could be the reasons?
[04-14-2006 07:25:33] [#ezpublish] <niooi> everything seems to be activated in the site.ini
[04-14-2006 07:27:01] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> have you clear the caches after cache-block addition ?
[04-14-2006 07:28:20] [#ezpublish] <niooi> yes
[04-14-2006 07:28:23] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I also tried to make create an object full of empty required fields - other required fields are recognized as required - this does not happen with the EOR field

[04-14-2006 08:00:52] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I updated this morning, and the issue remained
[04-14-2006 08:01:12] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> www.bartelme.at has someone seen this search module somewere ?
[04-14-2006 08:01:33] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: but I stress the fact that issues apperead after I cleaned up
[04-14-2006 08:01:45] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: i.e., removed all dummy content
[04-14-2006 08:02:01] [#ezpublish] <buz> then it's likely some class definition that doesnt fit?

[04-14-2006 08:14:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> what about it
[04-14-2006 08:15:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> it update the sort list automatically
[04-14-2006 08:16:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> well it would have to
[04-14-2006 08:16:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> i explicitely didnt add that
[04-14-2006 08:16:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> it would cause a lot of server load for little gain
[04-14-2006 08:17:01] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> that can be an option

[04-14-2006 09:10:00] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> what i did: i have stop using alt field ;)
[04-14-2006 09:10:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> not an option
[04-14-2006 09:10:18] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> alt is important for referencing

[04-14-2006 09:25:29] [#ezpublish] <phretor> major features are available
[04-14-2006 09:25:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> it should not and does not
[04-14-2006 09:25:42] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> you get many references problems
[04-14-2006 09:25:43] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[04-14-2006 09:25:51] [#ezpublish] <phretor> DiGiTa|_: that's my major problem :-)
[04-14-2006 09:33:45] [#ezpublish] <phretor> btw, I hope that all default templates of ez3.8 have been reviewed to make 'em w3c valid
[04-14-2006 09:34:13] [#ezpublish] <phretor> and I hope all <div class="footer"><div class="footer-design"> have been removed
[04-14-2006 09:34:27] [#ezpublish] <phretor> the markup of previous releases was a mess
[04-14-2006 09:34:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> theres actually a lot of point in that markup
[04-14-2006 09:34:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> nested divs give great flexibility
[04-14-2006 09:35:00] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: it's actually a piss over the markup semantic
[04-14-2006 09:35:11] [#ezpublish] <buz> its not supposed to be semantic for the most part
[04-14-2006 09:35:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> besides the markup is quite good
[04-14-2006 09:35:31] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I'm not claiming that ez should support it
[04-14-2006 09:36:07] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: I hope ;-) since I noticed a lot of <div class="break"></div> and things like that :-D
[04-14-2006 09:36:28] [#ezpublish] <phretor> buz: if you need a markup reviewer, I'm here
[04-14-2006 09:41:57] [#ezpublish] <buz> personally i would rather need a designer
[04-14-2006 09:42:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hey, what's $nodeAssignment->ID good for? it0s not the object ID nor the node ID.
[04-14-2006 09:42:46] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> i prefer create my own templates
[04-14-2006 09:42:47] [#ezpublish] <DiGiTa|_> :)
[04-14-2006 09:43:01] [#ezpublish] <niooi> one on the problem we had CachedViewModes = pdf; only...
[04-14-2006 09:43:09] [#ezpublish] <niooi> on=of
[04-14-2006 09:43:22] [#ezpublish] <niooi> therefore the pages were not cached
[04-14-2006 09:49:15] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> seems better
[04-14-2006 09:49:54] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> niooi: so what did you put instead CachedViewModes= full; sitemap; pdf;
[04-14-2006 09:50:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> so how fast are you're page loads now?
[04-14-2006 09:51:07] [#ezpublish] <niooi> much faster
[04-14-2006 09:51:20] [#ezpublish] <niooi> we still have some templates not cached
[04-14-2006 09:51:37] [#ezpublish] <niooi> we went from 150 sql queries to 33
[04-14-2006 09:51:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> mhh 0.77s aint that bad
[04-14-2006 09:51:48] [#ezpublish] <niooi> hopefully to 3 soon
[04-14-2006 10:01:07] [#ezpublish] <katana`> ah that's better :)
[04-14-2006 10:01:37] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> katana : does it make sense to add the line view in CachedViewModes ?
[04-14-2006 10:02:03] [#ezpublish] <katana`> nope
[04-14-2006 10:02:11] [#ezpublish] <katana`> the line view is not per say the execution of a module
[04-14-2006 10:02:37] [#ezpublish] <katana`> e.g. it does not depend on a call of the kernel/content/view.php script, it's just a class that is being executed
[04-14-2006 10:02:49] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> ok ;) just to be sure ;)
[04-14-2006 10:02:54] [#ezpublish] <katana`> the full view cache will take care of listings in the main area, while cache blocks will take care of the rest
[04-14-2006 10:02:56] [#ezpublish] <katana`> no problem :)
