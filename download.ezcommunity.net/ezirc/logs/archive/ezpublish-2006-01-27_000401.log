[01-26-2006 08:19:29] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hi guys
[01-26-2006 08:19:39] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> hi Sulfur
[01-26-2006 08:22:02] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I need some help on something on which I can't find documentation ... maybe fh , _kore , kore__ , ordnas can clarify me this. in my extension, I use function_definition.php to define the fields I can specify in my PHP code to make the fetch.
[01-26-2006 08:22:25] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> in method definition() there is this  'parameter_type' => 'standard' line in all examples. but I cannot understand how the specified parameters are passed to the underlying method ?
[01-26-2006 08:23:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it seems they are mapped positionally, which gives me some big trouble in case of optional parameters. is there a way to map them by name ?
[01-26-2006 08:23:48] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> I suppsoe I need to change that 'standard' to something else, and add some extra info ... but what info?
[01-26-2006 08:25:52] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> anyone can shed some light? :)

[01-26-2006 08:31:23] [#ezpublish] <kalooni> idem
[01-26-2006 08:31:28] [#ezpublish] <zrg> or then, wait..
[01-26-2006 08:31:46] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it's not lack of smartness zrg .... you have to have coded into it to know ..... :)
[01-26-2006 08:33:49] [#ezpublish] <zrg> there was a extension i made once.. cant find..
[01-26-2006 08:40:12] [#ezpublish] <zrg> cand even find one i made it after.. there was some extension that added redirect operator to templates
[01-26-2006 08:43:41] [#ezpublish] <kore__> You mean something like this Sulfur? ... 'parameters' => array( array( 'name' => 'offset', 'type' => 'integer', 'required' => true, 'default' => false ),  arra( 'name' => 'limit', 'type' => 'integer', 'required' => false, 'default' => 42 ))
[01-26-2006 08:46:58] [#ezpublish] <zrg> ok by off chance it helps you: i made my operators by modifying this http://ez.no/community/contribs/template_plugins/redirect_operators
[01-26-2006 08:47:25] [#ezpublish] <zrg> kind of remember they had optional parameters
[01-26-2006 08:47:36] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kore__:  yes, I need to know how they are mapped to the parameters of the method specified in the 'method' key
[01-26-2006 09:07:59] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kore__:  ?
[01-26-2006 09:09:25] [#ezpublish] <kore__> OK, so you want to know, what happens with 2 optional paramters, when you enter only the second one?
[01-26-2006 09:10:18] [#ezpublish] <kore__> afaik this is not passible ... as you can define default values, these are used for optnal parameters, but if you want to set the second one from the template you would have to define the first optional, too
[01-26-2006 09:10:27] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> yes kore__ well what happens I know --- params get mismatched! :)) I need to know if there are options other than 'standard' that will allow mw to map the tetch parameters to the function parameters
[01-26-2006 09:11:09] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ah ... so let's say I need to pass only params 1 and 5, I have to pass params 2 3 and 4 too ?
[01-26-2006 09:12:18] [#ezpublish] <kore__> Yes, I think so - there is no possibilty for named paramteers - you may want to use a hash as one parameter, where you can define key-associations...
[01-26-2006 09:13:17] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> hmmmmm.....
[01-26-2006 09:13:22] [#ezpublish] <kore__> like you do in the fetch-functions, where the first two parameters are fixed (like content, list) and the third is a hash with a list of completely position independent parameters
[01-26-2006 09:13:51] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kore__: I am actually doing that. the problem is this: maybe I should pastebin it
[01-26-2006 09:15:44] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kore__:  http://pastebin.com/524019
[01-26-2006 09:20:55] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so as you see I have all optional parameters , just as in ez's fetches, I am not bound t ospecify even parameters that I will not use
[01-26-2006 09:21:16] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> so there must be a way ... but which one .. ?
[01-26-2006 09:23:20] [#ezpublish] <kore__> As I said, just use only one parameter (a hash), where you define all your parameters as key=>value pairs
[01-26-2006 09:25:01] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> and how do I specify a hash parameter into function_definition.php ?
[01-26-2006 09:25:40] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur>                                                 array(

[01-26-2006 09:25:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur>                                                      ),
[01-26-2006 09:28:47] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> ok kore__ --- it seems I am getting somewhere.
[01-26-2006 09:29:22] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> it seems that the params are EVAL'ed .... so passing the array as string appears to work
[01-26-2006 09:38:24] [#ezpublish] <kore__> 'type' => 'array' and 'default' => array() I think, but I'am not sure
[01-26-2006 09:38:43] [#ezpublish] <kore__> Just look at some od the standard modules like kernel/content/ or such
[01-26-2006 09:38:58] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> kore__: seems to work with "string"

[01-26-2006 11:12:28] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> well, I am in my extension so I can make it dish out a csv string, but I suppose I also need to set a header or something

[01-26-2006 12:47:43] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> ... all the links, on the website, are still using the first url : site.com/abc .Because in the site.ini, I did not changed yet the siteaccessURL.
[01-26-2006 12:47:59] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you can change the site-url in the look and feel setup also.
[01-26-2006 12:48:39] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> that is not a problem
[01-26-2006 12:48:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> otherwise you have to set a rewrite-rule for the abc
[01-26-2006 12:49:05] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> there is a rewrite rule
[01-26-2006 12:49:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so there is no need to change ezs´ configuration.
[01-26-2006 12:51:22] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> well, all url, generated in template, still use the siteURL field defined in site.ini.append ...
[01-26-2006 12:51:30] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> so I need to modified this parameter
[01-26-2006 12:52:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so no internal rewrite would manage this?
[01-26-2006 12:53:14] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> well, there is no internal rewrite
[01-26-2006 12:53:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you would have to define one.
[01-26-2006 12:53:30] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> there is a rewrite on the apache of the proxy
[01-26-2006 12:53:39] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> but nothing localy
[01-26-2006 12:54:54] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> I have to do some rewrite rule locally anyway ? what for ?
[01-26-2006 12:55:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so the rewrite rule on the proxy would envoke your ez-app with the normal urls as before?
[01-26-2006 12:55:49] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> mm, let me check...
[01-26-2006 12:56:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> if so why to change the configuration?
[01-26-2006 12:56:31] [#ezpublish] <y_sabal> the rewite rule make a straight use of IPs

[01-26-2006 12:56:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> its about the url i tought?

[01-26-2006 12:57:08] [#ezpublish] * _buz is looking for a scalable forum package
[01-26-2006 12:57:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> scalable in which concern?
[01-26-2006 12:57:47] [#ezpublish] <_buz> lots of traffic, posts and users
[01-26-2006 12:57:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hey, buz btw. long time not see.
[01-26-2006 12:58:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> whereas lots is >5000 users, 100s to 1000s posts a day
[01-26-2006 12:58:14] [#ezpublish] <_buz> unspecified amount of page hits
[01-26-2006 12:59:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> you want a standalone-app? phpbb probably?
[01-26-2006 13:00:03] [#ezpublish] <_buz> phpbb is out of question
[01-26-2006 13:00:09] [#ezpublish] <_buz> i was thining phorum maybe

[01-26-2006 13:01:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> why is phpbb out of question? phorum is not the style i like, but its a long time ago i tested it.
[01-26-2006 13:01:31] [#ezpublish] <_buz> phpbb is slow and riddled with holes
[01-26-2006 13:01:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i dont like phorums-threading-style
[01-26-2006 13:02:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> how about vBulletin
[01-26-2006 13:02:51] [#ezpublish] <_buz> thought about it but i'd prefere FOSS
[01-26-2006 13:03:10] [#ezpublish] <_buz> vbulletin can handle lots of traffic i believe
[01-26-2006 13:03:41] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yes.
[01-26-2006 13:04:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> i know a site with : Threads: 43,116, Posts: 348,178, Members: 7,718

[01-26-2006 13:06:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yeah, also fine.
[01-26-2006 13:06:33] [#ezpublish] <_buz> (it's kinda embarassing to use commercial forum on a linux community site i think=
[01-26-2006 13:06:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> seems to run under heavy load.
[01-26-2006 13:06:44] [#ezpublish] <_buz> dunno about the servers behind it
[01-26-2006 13:06:51] [#ezpublish] <_buz> cannonical gives major backing for ubuntu
