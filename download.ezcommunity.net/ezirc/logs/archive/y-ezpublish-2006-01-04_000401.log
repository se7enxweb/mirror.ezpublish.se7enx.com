[12-28-2005 06:45:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> at which place for instance the extension ezpaypal is recognized as a module by the ezsystem? There only have to be an entry in the Extensions-Array within the ini-settings and a module.php in the extension-dir to be a module?
[12-28-2005 06:50:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well ezpaypal is special
[12-28-2005 06:50:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> not special but..
[12-28-2005 06:51:12] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's both a workflow extension (it defines events) and a design extension
[12-28-2005 06:51:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> workflow.ini.append and design.ini.append in the ext
[12-28-2005 06:52:01] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> hmm
[12-28-2005 06:53:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> so when i want to implement the edit action for a specific contentObject i must write into the kernel dir and register a module?
[12-28-2005 06:54:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> humm... the action is already written isn't it ? :)
[12-28-2005 06:54:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what do you want to do exactly ?
[12-28-2005 06:54:31] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> (usually, you just load a module in the siteaccess, and the ini files for the module itself define what the module provides
[12-28-2005 06:54:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> I dont want to touch the existing code for the edit.php action
[12-28-2005 06:54:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you should be able to add a custom action
[12-28-2005 06:56:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> bei altering the module.php and edit.php in kernel/content/? this means to change code of ez. therefor i would register a new module with my new functions in it?!
[12-28-2005 06:56:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but how you would add a custom action then?
[12-28-2005 06:57:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> this would mean to alter the kernel/content/edit.php?!
[12-28-2005 06:58:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> nope
[12-28-2005 06:58:15] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> sec ;)
[12-28-2005 06:59:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana` | >what do you want to do exactly ? I am implementing a webservice including new ezcontentClasses for contentObject with own functions, which i would implement by defining a module.
[12-28-2005 07:00:13] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you can add an action by using an action extension ;)

[12-28-2005 07:01:44] [#ezpublish] <Shai_Tan> maybe some intelligent ones also
[12-28-2005 07:02:07] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> damn maybe it's the only undocumented one ;)
[12-28-2005 07:02:13] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hmm, what is the default username/password when doing a manual installation (http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_6/installation/manual_installation/manual_configuration_of_ez_publish) ?
[12-28-2005 07:02:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> the basics are here : http://ez.no/products/ez_publish_cms/documentation/development/extensions/introduction_to_extensions
[12-28-2005 07:02:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it talks about actions a bit
[12-28-2005 07:02:39] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> thank you, Katana` ;)
[12-28-2005 07:03:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> basically
[12-28-2005 07:03:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> content.ini.append in your ext

[12-28-2005 07:04:27] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep
[12-28-2005 07:04:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok ;)

[12-28-2005 07:05:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but the missing link was the mentioned by you the content.ini.append
[12-28-2005 07:05:54] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> this one
[12-28-2005 07:07:01] [#ezpublish] * SEAwolfx is examining the content.ini.append
[12-28-2005 07:09:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> mhmmm .. doesnt get the role content.ini.append. i expexted to see here the relation between the contentObject-Type and the extension beeing triggered.
[12-28-2005 07:09:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hummm... no
[12-28-2005 07:10:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> what content.ini.append does is just inform eZPublish that your extension defines an action handler
[12-28-2005 07:10:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you call an action using the button name
[12-28-2005 07:10:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but ok, when i go the ezpaypal-way the module is triggered by .../index.php/<siteacces>/ezpaypal/edit/224
[12-28-2005 07:10:51] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> <input name="ActionDoSomething" will automatically trigger your action
[12-28-2005 07:11:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana` | >what content.ini.append does is just inform eZPublish that your extension defines an action  handler <- ahh ;)
[12-28-2005 07:11:09] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> maybe there's an override for the edit template ?
[12-28-2005 07:11:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's basically the same for every action type
[12-28-2005 07:12:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> ok I will have to rewrite my already written code to be an extension ;)
[12-28-2005 07:13:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> thank you, Katana`!
[12-28-2005 07:13:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana`: is there another extension which is implemented this way?

[12-28-2005 07:41:53] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> Katana` | >what content.ini.append does is just inform eZPublish that your extension defines an action handler <- but for a specific datatype. in my case i havent invented a new datatype rather a new contentObjectClass. this works as well for Classes?
[12-28-2005 07:42:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> err yes, you can declare a new datatype in an extension of course
[12-28-2005 07:43:01] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> same doc page url i gave before

[12-28-2005 07:48:40] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> but as i mentioned before the myextension/modules/edit.php should be envoked when an object of a certain contentObjectClass defined by me is going to be edited. so the trigger must depent on the class the object is instantiated of.
[12-28-2005 07:49:10] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> then you have to add an override template for content/edit/full.tpl for that specific content class
[12-28-2005 07:49:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and have it trigger your action
[12-28-2005 07:49:43] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> yaeh, this makes more sense for me now.
[12-28-2005 07:50:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you'll see, extensions make sense
[12-28-2005 07:50:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but what's your custom action supposed to do ? i'm not actually sure you need one
[12-28-2005 07:51:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> an custom action could be submit which actually sends a webservice message to an extern system for instance.
[12-28-2005 07:52:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> and you want it triggered when you edit a contentclass that uses your custom datatype ?
[12-28-2005 07:53:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> now when the submit/button is pressed in the view_full.tpl for my certain contentObject

[12-28-2005 09:24:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> if ez is a 500pound gorilla then plone is a 10ton elephant
[12-28-2005 09:24:14] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 10 ton elephant
[12-28-2005 09:24:22] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> they made a movie about plone lately
[12-28-2005 09:24:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> fortunately it died at the end
[12-28-2005 09:24:31] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> :) If I wanted to customize plone the way I wanted I had to spend a lot of time learning python. In eZ I belive I can do the same just by learning eZp and the template system
[12-28-2005 09:24:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> btw, imho you dont need a apche with dav support as the ezsource reimplemnts the protocol.
[12-28-2005 09:24:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep exactly
[12-28-2005 09:24:56] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> eZ focuses on not requiring external apache / php modules
[12-28-2005 09:25:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> which is both boon and bane
[12-28-2005 09:25:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> yes.
[12-28-2005 09:25:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> sometimes external modules would likely be faster
[12-28-2005 09:25:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> python rules;)
[12-28-2005 09:25:25] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-28-2005 09:25:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> python is a nice language
[12-28-2005 09:25:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> but zope is a piece of shit
[12-28-2005 09:25:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> but they limit adoption :(
[12-28-2005 09:25:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> you mean it's enough to put webdav.localhost in /etc/hosts, fix webdav.ini in site.ini override and clear cache?
[12-28-2005 09:25:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hehe, never touched plone.
[12-28-2005 09:25:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-28-2005 09:26:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but how about using only zope?
[12-28-2005 09:26:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> xiglet: you need some modrewrite trickery, too
[12-28-2005 09:26:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> zope itself is worthless
[12-28-2005 09:26:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-28-2005 09:26:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> as usually
[12-28-2005 09:26:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> plone is of marginal use if you have shitloads of time
[12-28-2005 09:26:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> or some crazy customer who insists on not using php, yeah whatever
[12-28-2005 09:27:03] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> heeh, i would like to examine the contentObject-model of zope to campare it to ez.
[12-28-2005 09:27:18] [#ezpublish] <buz> zope is a complete database
[12-28-2005 09:27:33] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's kind of like the emacs of the cms world
[12-28-2005 09:27:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> it does everything, somehow
[12-28-2005 09:28:08] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> well, this is what is called objectoriented database.
[12-28-2005 09:28:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> i call it useless
[12-28-2005 09:28:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's so slow that people invariably end up caching the heck out of it or moving to RDBMS backend
[12-28-2005 09:29:47] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> at the end all date are stored relational but the layer above could give the oo-features.
[12-28-2005 09:30:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> s/date/pieces of data/
[12-28-2005 09:30:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if that's how ZODB really works
[12-28-2005 09:30:29] [#ezpublish] <buz> it seems like an arbitrary datastore to me
[12-28-2005 09:30:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> the concept is neat, but i shiver when i remember using that incarnation of it
[12-28-2005 09:31:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmm, or the data is stored in a structured way like in a XML-DB
[12-28-2005 09:31:26] [#ezpublish] <buz> and to top it off, a bug in some obscure, hardly used script can crash the whole server whereas in php you'll only get fatal error for requests to that codepath
[12-28-2005 09:32:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmm ... so Zope runs top on a application server, i doubt this.
[12-28-2005 09:32:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> i've seen it happen many many times
[12-28-2005 09:32:42] [#ezpublish] <buz> something would crash, and the application server would just sit there spewing out errors to all further request
[12-28-2005 09:33:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> what kind of application server this is?
[12-28-2005 09:33:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> zope IS the application server
[12-28-2005 09:33:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the python_module for apache?
[12-28-2005 09:33:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> no thats just the interpreter for parts of it
[12-28-2005 09:34:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> unless you consider mod_php as app server too
[12-28-2005 09:34:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> and this runs above the python_module with apache.
[12-28-2005 09:34:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ok
[12-28-2005 09:34:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> no, i wouldnt.
[12-28-2005 09:34:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[12-28-2005 09:34:34] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah neither would i ;)
[12-28-2005 09:34:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> tomcat maybe
[12-28-2005 09:34:43] [#ezpublish] <buz> jboss definitely
[12-28-2005 09:35:19] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> for this it would lacks on functionality application server usaually have.
[12-28-2005 09:36:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but for the difference between tomcat and zope is that zope doesnt includes a webserver.
[12-28-2005 09:36:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually it does
[12-28-2005 09:36:49] [#ezpublish] <buz> it's just not recommended that you use it it's so awfully slow
[12-28-2005 09:36:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> it does, so the python_module for apache isnt required?!
[12-28-2005 09:37:05] [#ezpublish] <buz> you can do totally without apache
[12-28-2005 09:37:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ah, ok. ;)
[12-28-2005 09:38:13] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this clears things up for me.
[12-28-2005 09:39:51] [#ezpublish] * SEAwolfx_ is going into the kitchen for dinner.
[12-28-2005 09:42:49] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I guess this is an apache question, but I would appreciate if someone could answer this. I read about "Setting up webdav" at ez.no. I enabled webdav with webdav.ini, cleared cache, added webdav.localhost.localdomain in /etc/hosts, configured apache2 (debian) as explained in step5 in the doc (created this entry in the file /etc/apache2/sites-available and created a symlink to sites-enabled, restarted apache2). Konqueror says webdav://webdav.local
[12-28-2005 09:43:45] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> If I change from Virtualhost * to Virtualhost 127.0.0.1 in the apache2 file, webdav kind of works but all access to the site asks for webdav authentication
[12-28-2005 09:45:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> re
[12-28-2005 09:46:15] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> xiglet: if you have no dav-module enabled within apache this is the output of the ezwebdav module.
[12-28-2005 09:47:44] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> access to the site asks for webdav authentication <- this is normal behavior when you are navigating into folders requireing the appropriate permissions.
[12-28-2005 09:49:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> .oO( where is the question? )
[12-28-2005 09:57:03] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok.. some food now and i'll look into it
[12-28-2005 10:00:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> now wheres the champagne http://www.triligon.org/blog/end_of_an_era
[12-28-2005 10:00:50] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> more eZ Publish for you then ? :)
[12-28-2005 10:00:59] [#ezpublish] <buz> perhaps
[12-28-2005 10:01:22] [#ezpublish] <buz> but first i need to dive into the venture capital scene
[12-28-2005 10:01:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> i have plans for what would surely be the, by orders of magnitudes, biggest ez site
[12-28-2005 10:01:47] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-28-2005 10:01:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hehehe cool :))
[12-28-2005 10:02:21] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> beware, when waterproof.fr has been ported to eZ, you'll have a competitor ;)
[12-28-2005 10:02:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> biggest includes much bigger than ez.no ;)
[12-28-2005 10:03:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> like cnn ? :)
[12-28-2005 10:04:28] [#ezpublish] <buz> think livejournal
[12-28-2005 10:04:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah yes
[12-28-2005 10:04:55] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure if ez could cope with that, anyway
[12-28-2005 10:08:19] -!- _thomas [n=thomas@62.134.233.72] has joined #ezpublish

[12-28-2005 10:30:15] [#ezpublish] <xbit> when will planetezpublish.org be up again?
[12-28-2005 10:35:19] [#ezpublish] <xbit> or...up :o
[12-28-2005 10:40:06] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-28-2005 10:40:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> buz, sure, with the correct hosting platform
[12-28-2005 10:40:53] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ezpub.co.uk did not survive eighter :(
[12-28-2005 10:41:03] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :(
[12-28-2005 10:45:31] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have webdav up and working on another server here, but I haven't done anything speicial to enable webdav support in apache
[12-28-2005 10:46:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> as I already said no apache web-dav support required.
[12-28-2005 10:46:03] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> (what was really for SEAwolfx from a question some time ago :) )
[12-28-2005 10:46:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> oh
[12-28-2005 10:46:31] [#ezpublish] <buz> Katana`: yeah but does ez scale to 10mio objects?
[12-28-2005 10:46:39] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i'd say no :)
[12-28-2005 10:46:40] [#ezpublish] <buz> even creation of 100000 takes hours
[12-28-2005 10:46:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> [16:25:19]<SEAwolfx_>btw, imho you dont need a apche with dav support as the ezsource reimplemnts the protocol.
[12-28-2005 10:47:08] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ah :) by bad
[12-28-2005 10:47:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> as long as the app scales sanely (i.e. linearly) i can always throw more hardware at it
[12-28-2005 10:47:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> np ;)
[12-28-2005 10:47:28] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you'd have to check that with eZ
[12-28-2005 10:47:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> i rather check myself
[12-28-2005 10:47:43] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-28-2005 10:47:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have about 10.000 mp3 files, my plan was to import id3 tags from all files into ezp objects (when I get better at this) ). Bad idea?
[12-28-2005 10:47:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> i'd venture to guess ez doesnt really know either
[12-28-2005 10:48:05] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> 10.000 is not huge
[12-28-2005 10:48:07] [#ezpublish] <buz> xiglet: 100K objects works quite well
[12-28-2005 10:48:11] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> well they'd probably have some insight
[12-28-2005 10:48:12] [#ezpublish] <buz> just takes a while to get them in the db
[12-28-2005 10:48:19] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> ok
[12-28-2005 10:48:27] [#ezpublish] <buz> well 100K is no problem
[12-28-2005 10:48:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> but 10 or 100times that might be one
[12-28-2005 10:48:46] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yep
[12-28-2005 10:48:56] [#ezpublish] <xbit> is there a id3-importer? or do you plan to write that functionality yourself, xiglet ?
[12-28-2005 10:49:08] -!- ordnas [n=ordnas@p549D6A40.dip.t-dialin.net] has left #ezpublish []
[12-28-2005 10:49:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> and if it scales even slightly worse than linear you're bound to run into trouble eventually
[12-28-2005 10:49:20] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> for ezp 2.0 i have made such a module ;)
[12-28-2005 10:49:37] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I haven't heard of anyone ... I guess I have to write something on my own, but i'm not nearly good enough
[12-28-2005 10:49:45] [#ezpublish] <xbit> fancy SEAwolfx_ :)
[12-28-2005 10:49:52] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah you gotta write one yourself
[12-28-2005 10:49:58] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> eZ Publish Network is for up to 250 000 objects
[12-28-2005 10:50:06] [#ezpublish] <buz> point
[12-28-2005 10:50:12] [#ezpublish] <xbit> there's some id3-php-classes so shouldn't be to hard
[12-28-2005 10:50:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> yeah
[12-28-2005 10:50:28] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hehe, i based on a already implemented id3-tag-php-lib, nothing more.
[12-28-2005 10:50:28] [#ezpublish] <xbit> but pretty slow i can imagine
[12-28-2005 10:50:33] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> you can contact eZ for more though
[12-28-2005 10:50:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> enough, imho ;)
[12-28-2005 10:50:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> otoh, the limit could be pretty arbitrary
[12-28-2005 10:50:53] [#ezpublish] <buz> for any halfway  normal site, 250K is more than enough
[12-28-2005 10:50:55] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i think there's indeed a limit in the algorithm used by the treenode system
[12-28-2005 10:51:07] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> let me know when you have this id3-import-function ready folks ;-)
[12-28-2005 10:51:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah treenode is my main worry
[12-28-2005 10:51:17] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> write it and make a contrib ;)
[12-28-2005 10:51:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> lolz ;)
[12-28-2005 10:51:32] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's not funny
[12-28-2005 10:51:36] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ;)
[12-28-2005 10:51:38] [#ezpublish] <buz> its OSS
[12-28-2005 10:51:41] [#ezpublish] <buz> do it yourself ;)
[12-28-2005 10:51:44] [#ezpublish] <buz> use the source, luke
[12-28-2005 10:51:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;)
[12-28-2005 10:51:59] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> If I ever manage to make a function like that i'll sure give it away
[12-28-2005 10:52:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> god damn dell bastards. their gorgeos 20" lcd costs 40% less in the us
[12-28-2005 10:52:21] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> to bad i'm spending 99% of my time with windows servers ... yeah, it's my job
[12-28-2005 10:52:26] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it's not that hard xiglet
[12-28-2005 10:52:34] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> have a look at somewhat similar contributions
[12-28-2005 10:52:35] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> for you, it's not
[12-28-2005 10:52:38] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> images import or something
[12-28-2005 10:52:40] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> no i'm serious
[12-28-2005 10:52:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> na it's not really that hard
[12-28-2005 10:52:49] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> it'd really be a nice contrib
[12-28-2005 10:53:13] [#ezpublish] <buz> plus points if it works on a wlan pd
[12-28-2005 10:53:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> a
[12-28-2005 10:53:16] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> hmm too bad the metadata extraction mechanism is just for images
[12-28-2005 10:53:20] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :))
[12-28-2005 10:53:29] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> no idea how it's done .. First I have to learn the template system well.. I'm looking forward to the new book ez systems are working on
[12-28-2005 10:53:36] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://pear.php.net/package/MP3_ID
[12-28-2005 10:53:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> And I have to learn PHP I guess
[12-28-2005 10:53:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah
[12-28-2005 10:53:53] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> :)
[12-28-2005 10:53:57] [#ezpublish] <xbit> hehe
[12-28-2005 10:53:58] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually learning php would be more imporatnt than the template sytem for that job
[12-28-2005 10:54:21] [#ezpublish] <xbit> i just need to double the number of hours in a day, and i could do it
[12-28-2005 10:54:22] [#ezpublish] <xbit> :)
[12-28-2005 10:54:35] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the problem is rather how to get the webdav working to display these id3 attributes in the browser ;)
[12-28-2005 10:54:44] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> ah yes
[12-28-2005 10:54:50] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I coded some stuff in turbo pascal 6 in the old days :)
[12-28-2005 10:54:52] [#ezpublish] <Katana`> i have never found any doc about that...
[12-28-2005 10:54:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hihi
[12-28-2005 10:55:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> Katana`: me either.
[12-28-2005 10:55:12] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> +n
[12-28-2005 10:55:15] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think that could work
[12-28-2005 10:55:32] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think webdav has provisions to carry arbirtrary meta data
[12-28-2005 10:55:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> its also a problem of the webdav-client.
[12-28-2005 10:56:02] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah exactly
[12-28-2005 10:56:24] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;) explorer != konqueror
[12-28-2005 10:56:41] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> http://webdav.localhost.localdomain/nvp/ works, but not with webdav://webdav.lo............... (
[12-28-2005 10:56:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> konqueror >> $filemanager
[12-28-2005 10:57:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> concerning webdav-support
[12-28-2005 10:57:30] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> konqueror 3.5 ... yummy
[12-28-2005 10:57:38] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> xiglet: this depends what client u are using.
[12-28-2005 10:57:44] [#ezpublish] * buz is drooling over kde4
[12-28-2005 10:57:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hmm.
[12-28-2005 10:58:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> no, there is something with my apache2 support .. going crazy here :'(
[12-28-2005 10:58:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> xiglet: maybe u have to compile konqueror with webdav support?1
[12-28-2005 10:59:17] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> no, it worked some time ago with this client .. I just don't know what I'm doing wrong with apache2
[12-28-2005 10:59:38] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I have a guy at jabber here, he could probably help me
[12-28-2005 10:59:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> btw .. try cadaver;)
[12-28-2005 11:00:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> its also a neat webdav-client for console.
[12-28-2005 11:01:09] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> yeah, read about it now
[12-28-2005 11:02:09] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> connection refused, somethink bad with my apache2 config
[12-28-2005 11:02:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hm?!?!?
[12-28-2005 11:03:40] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> did some hacking on my apache2 virtualhost ... webdav works now (but nothing else, must take a look at that later)
[12-28-2005 11:04:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> using webdav://webd.. the client have to interpret what protocol should be used for connection
[12-28-2005 11:04:44] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> tried to upload a picture, but it created a "new folder" ... *lol*
[12-28-2005 11:05:01] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> (with konqueror that is)
[12-28-2005 11:05:08] [#ezpublish] <buz> actually i think OSX uses http:// for webdav
[12-28-2005 11:05:14] [#ezpublish] <buz> yeah
[12-28-2005 11:05:21] [#ezpublish] <buz> konqi doesnt quite work right with webdav in 3.6
[12-28-2005 11:05:24] [#ezpublish] <buz> dunno why
[12-28-2005 11:05:56] [#ezpublish] <xiglet> I belive this is 3.7
[12-28-2005 11:06:03] [#ezpublish] <buz> not sure about that one
[12-28-2005 11:06:20] [#ezpublish] <buz> ezwebdav  seems to have a somewhat weird interpretation of that spec
[12-28-2005 11:07:46] [#ezpublish] <buz> http://ez.no/community/contribs/datatypes/regular_expression_textline that is neat

[12-28-2005 11:10:23] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> for this would make sense of an additional attribute used for an element of a form.

[12-28-2005 11:13:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but here are others doing this.
[12-28-2005 11:14:30] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> I wonder if there are any plans to make the same integration with word as they have with openoffice writer
[12-28-2005 11:15:04] [#ezpublish] <buz> i doubt it
[12-28-2005 11:15:07] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> after all, all of my customers are using msoffice
[12-28-2005 11:15:17] [#ezpublish] <buz> i dont think its feasible

[12-28-2005 11:15:36] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> maybe when they open up their format, the XML-think in the new version
[12-28-2005 11:15:48] [#ezpublish] <buz> that xml looks totally insane

[12-28-2005 11:16:18] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> that bad?
[12-28-2005 11:16:42] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> I guess it is to make it compatible backwards or something

[12-28-2005 11:17:33] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> when it is deterministic it is parseable ;)
[12-28-2005 11:17:50] [#ezpublish] <buz> not even word itself can always parse its output
[12-28-2005 11:18:09] [#ezpublish] <buz> will they force Katana` to use linux in ez france?
[12-28-2005 11:18:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> hihi

[12-28-2005 11:22:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but to parse for instance a complex xml-structure like ms xml or docbook it shouldnt be that hard to abstract it to a less complex format.
[12-28-2005 11:23:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the other way is horror.
[12-28-2005 11:27:18] [#ezpublish] <xigle7> the only reason I have to use webdav is to upload .jpg files. Is it necesarry to define mimeclassmap ?
[12-28-2005 11:27:37] [#ezpublish] <buz> i think images are handled that way by default
[12-28-2005 11:27:39] [#ezpublish] <buz> but i could be wrong
[12-28-2005 11:28:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> no thats eight i would say, its handled by default.
