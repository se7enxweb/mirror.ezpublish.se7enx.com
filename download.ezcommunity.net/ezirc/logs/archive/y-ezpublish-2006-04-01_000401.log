[03-30-2006 10:23:36] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> you want to add a new tag inside a page, dynamically, right ?
[03-30-2006 10:23:41] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> uhm.. you could just do an innerhtml replace
[03-30-2006 10:23:59] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> if so, document.createElement(your_tag_name)

[03-30-2006 12:18:09] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> is it possible to redirect back to the current page when I update a webshop basket (i.e. change the number of items to be bought)
[03-30-2006 12:18:19] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> RedirectAfterAddToBasket=basket doesn't seem to have any effect
[03-30-2006 12:19:02] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> well.. it has an effect, but only when adding items to basket
[03-30-2006 12:20:33] [#ezpublish] <ls> I haven't use it but let me check the code ...
[03-30-2006 12:21:05] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> should have been something like  RedirectAfterUpdateBasket
[03-30-2006 12:22:57] [#ezpublish] <ls> RedirectAfterAddToBasket=reload
[03-30-2006 12:26:07] [#ezpublish] <Tidemann> ls: doesn't have any effect on update basket

[03-30-2006 12:27:16] [#ezpublish] <ls> yep then is not supported on update
[03-30-2006 12:27:35] [#ezpublish] <ls> with reload works when you add something then you should back to page
[03-30-2006 12:28:03] [#ezpublish] <ls> with empty RedirectAfterAddToBasket you will be redirect to /shop/basket
[03-30-2006 12:29:56] [#ezpublish] <ls> btw, when you will make patch send it to sdk-public mailing list, then it has chance to be included in next eZp version

[03-30-2006 18:40:21] [#ezpublish] <kracker> hmm, so i'm wondering someone might ask as a support service fee to upgrade a medium sized eZ publish 3.5.2 to 3.6.7 aka how much might this be worth in USD$
[03-30-2006 18:42:03] [#ezpublish] <kracker> a client recently asked me for these services and i'm working on the project right now ... i guess i was trying to weigh others thoughts on the subject against what i've estimated/proposed to the client already
