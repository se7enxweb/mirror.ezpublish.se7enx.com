[01-24-2006 03:39:20] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> hi
[01-24-2006 03:39:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hi B-KiLLer`
[01-24-2006 03:39:41] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> w0000t :)
[01-24-2006 03:39:49] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> hey Sulfur
[01-24-2006 03:40:14] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> how can I proceed to have a object of the "file" class to be downloaded ?
[01-24-2006 03:40:41] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> let's say that /downloads/myfile is a "file" object
[01-24-2006 03:42:10] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the objects it self cant be downloaded only in form of a package.
[01-24-2006 03:42:36] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> or do you mean the content attribute (binary file)?
[01-24-2006 03:42:45] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> yes
[01-24-2006 03:43:38] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> so I uploaded a file using that file class, and now I want this binary file to be downloaded when I access the node
[01-24-2006 03:43:49] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> B-KiLLer`: you have to look into which template is used for it. I can't remember it now, but if you have "show used tpls" you'll find it easily
[01-24-2006 03:44:48] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> imo it is in a full_*.tpl for your contentclass.

[01-24-2006 03:59:22] [#ezpublish] <B-KiLLer`> how is this file reachable inside this node ?
[01-24-2006 04:00:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx> the datatype is handling the mapping to the var/.. folder in which the files are actually stored.
[01-24-2006 04:00:24] [#ezpublish] <Sulfur> B-KiLLer`: the view tpl for that attribute (not node) generates a link that allows the direct download of the file, since the file is stored on the filesystem.

[01-24-2006 16:14:52] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i got plenty of them
[01-24-2006 16:17:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> zrg: well, the problem is that i cant browse into the folders Media or Contents
[01-24-2006 16:17:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> but i can login for the <siteaccess>-folder
[01-24-2006 16:18:54] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> 'cd Content' in cadaver prints out: 'Could not access /web/Content/ (not WebDAV-enabled?):'
[01-24-2006 16:19:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> 'Did not find a collection resource.'
[01-24-2006 16:19:50] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> there seems to be a problem with the access set by the function 'setCurrentSite'
[01-24-2006 16:20:51] [#ezpublish] <zrg> testing
[01-24-2006 16:20:56] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> could you please print out in wedav.php before '$server->setCurrentSite( $currentSite)' the $currentSite-var?
[01-24-2006 16:21:51] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> eZWebDAVServer::appendLogEntry( "SEAWOLF:". $currentSite );
[01-24-2006 16:22:14] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> then you can see the output in the webdav.log
[01-24-2006 16:22:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> what dav client?
[01-24-2006 16:22:45] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> cadaver
[01-24-2006 16:23:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> was ok i think, can you try with konqueror?
[01-24-2006 16:23:31] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the client plays no role imo
[01-24-2006 16:23:38] [#ezpublish] <zrg> it may
[01-24-2006 16:23:58] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> important is the output of the $currentSite - var
[01-24-2006 16:24:29] [#ezpublish] <zrg> 3.6 site?
[01-24-2006 16:25:11] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> my siteaccess is 'web'
[01-24-2006 16:25:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> in webdav.log: 'SEAWOLF:web' when i access the web folder
[01-24-2006 16:25:59] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> zrg | >3.6 site <- yes
[01-24-2006 16:26:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> no
[01-24-2006 16:26:04] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> 3.7
[01-24-2006 16:26:21] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> sry
[01-24-2006 16:26:45] [#ezpublish] <zrg> hang on
[01-24-2006 16:27:00] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;) yes
[01-24-2006 16:28:32] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> in ezwebdavconentserver.php inside the function setCurrentSite i wrote this:
[01-24-2006 16:29:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> eZWebDAVServer::appendLogEntry( "SEAWOLF4: in setCurrentSite" );$access = changeAccess( $access );eZWebDAVServer::appendLogEntry( "SEAWOLF5: $access" );
[01-24-2006 16:29:22] [#ezpublish] <zrg> SEAWOLF:plain
[01-24-2006 16:29:37] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> i added the output before and after '$access = changeAccess( $access);'
[01-24-2006 16:30:02] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> here only 'SEAWOLF4: in setCurrentSite' is output
[01-24-2006 16:30:34] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> 'SEAWOLF5..' isnt printed out in the log. hmmmmm?!?!?
[01-24-2006 16:31:03] [#ezpublish] <zrg> mh?
[01-24-2006 16:31:22] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so it seems the changeAccess()-function in access.php is broken?!?!
[01-24-2006 16:32:30] [#ezpublish] <zrg> i dont know, works for me
[01-24-2006 16:32:55] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> did you have placed the debug-output also in the ezwebdavconentserver.php?
[01-24-2006 16:33:09] [#ezpublish] <zrg> no, ok i try
[01-24-2006 16:33:25] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> this would be very nice ;)
[01-24-2006 16:33:57] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> the problem is that i can only test with 3.7 as it is compatible with php 4.4
[01-24-2006 16:34:29] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so at the moment i cant test any 3.6 sites.
[01-24-2006 16:34:30] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ;(
[01-24-2006 16:36:05] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> 'SEAWOLF5..' never appears in my logs.
[01-24-2006 16:37:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> so the instruction pointer never comes back from the changeAccess()-function.
[01-24-2006 16:38:06] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> despite the contents of the my siteaccess 'web' IS printed out in cadaver.
[01-24-2006 16:38:18] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> +of
[01-24-2006 16:38:42] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> thats strange imho.
[01-24-2006 16:39:46] [#ezpublish] <zrg> that is not really "in" the site yet
[01-24-2006 16:40:01] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> btw, i recommend using cadaver as there are more pieces of information is output at the countraty to konqueror.
[01-24-2006 16:40:11] [#ezpublish] <zrg> adding above code in ezwebdavconentserver.php crashed it

[01-24-2006 16:49:01] [#ezpublish] <zrg> now ive fucked up something..
[01-24-2006 16:49:52] [#ezpublish] <SEAwolfx_> ahh ;(. just delete the lines of debug-output.
