## Why we continue to mirror these valuable training materials from eZ?

These pdf books were originally sold for minimal cost by eZ Systems to the developer community to speed up developer training and geberal adoption of the software stack for web application publishing.

Not long after the completion of the third book release all of these books were provided for free (the price of a fake email address for future advertizing mails only) to all anonymouse users of the company website ez.no to further grow the market and drive educational efforts to adopt the system.

because these book pdfs were distributed for no charge and freely available we have archives them here as a reference for current users and developers. as well as future community members who need training materials betond the limited distribution by the original author eZ Systems.

Please remember that originally eZ Publish core values centered around the simple principles of sharing information.

Feel free to now sing a little of the "Sharing song" by Jack Johnson that was a community theme aong we called the "eZ Sharing Song" that teaches the fundementals of our community sharing values and how it works if you join in the sharing!

# BuildSVN

BuildSVN was a basic solution to building and preparing eZ Publish for use from svn repository. Sadly this work did not teach maturity. Here is the remains of these efforts for learning.

Other loose files of interest to developers are available for study but are not specifically documented.
